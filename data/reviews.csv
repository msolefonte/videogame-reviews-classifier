82	                                Dying Light is one of the best ports we've seen on Nintendo Switch. Sure there are compromises here and there, on fps and details, but playing on portable almost make you forget about that. Add the huge amount of content, the local and online coop or new options like gyro controls, and you have a great game on the go.                             
80	                                Dying Light has found a new home and is worth returning to for both veteran fans and those touching down on Harran for the first time. Playing again made me excited for the sequel’s release and made me appreciate this title even more. This and more is what a port should do, so good luck and good night.                            
80	                                Dying Light: Platinum Edition remains one of the better examples of an open-world zombie game done right. It stands head-and-shoulders above other genre entries thanks to unique traversal and weapon creativity.                            
80	                                Dying Light Platinum Edition for Nintendo Switch is not the best version of this title. Yet the port itself is very competent, with reasonable technical compromises.                            
80	                                Dying Light on Switch is quite a remarkable achievement, and we’re happy to report that Techland has mostly stuck the landing with this one. Its ambitious open world full of zombies is unlike anything else in the Switch’s library and, between the core campaign and six years of constant DLC updates, there’s potentially hundreds of hours of enjoyment to be had here. Granted, all of this comes at the cost of performance that can be middling compared to other platforms, but this is neatly balanced out by the convenience of playing in handheld mode. We’d give Dying Light a strong recommendation, though with the caveat that Switch owners who rarely play in portable mode may want to pause and consider buying it elsewhere. Wherever you may fall, we’d strongly encourage you to consider this Switch port; it really is quite good.                            
80	                                Techland not only ported Dying Light to Switch well, but also added touchscreen support for menus and motion controls. In terms of features, this is one of the best big game conversions I’ve seen for Switch and it would be great if we actually saw more publishers and developers put in this much of an effort into their ports. While the Nintendo Switch version isn’t as good as other platforms in almost every way on a technical level, it is absolutely worth getting if you’ve wanted to experience the game and want it portable or only have a Nintendo Switch.                            
80	                                Embedding all the game's DLCs, expansion packs and original multi modes, Dying Light is making a great entry on Nintendo Switch. If this version is not the most beautiful to try today, given the concessions made to the display distance or the smoothness of the rendering (quite striking in docked mode), the particularly solid technique of this port forces everything so is respect and, if the game is slowly starting to age, this is a great opportunity to discover or rediscover this great success signed Techland.                             
80	                                Dying Light is six years old, but it hasn't lost its edge. A fantastic parkour system, extensive combat customization, and a unique take on the zombie-filled post-apocalyptic world mean Techland's horror game still holds its own after so long. Sure, the resolution could be better on Nintendo Switch, and it's still the same iffy story, but having Dying Light portable and with all the DLC more than makes up for that.                             
80	                                Dying Light Platinum Edition on Switch is an impressive port of a - still - very good game. Going back or for the first time to Harran on the Nintendo console is relevant as it offers the same fun of open world-survival-parkour action with only a few issues - juste forget about playing on you TV. It's smooth, doesn't load so much and, as it is the complete version of the Techland game, offers tons of content to players in need of zombies and a bit of horror.                             
80	                                Fortunately, Dying Light Platinum Edition for Nintendo Switch is a successful porting for Nintendo's hybrid. Despite the obvious and inevitable need to downgrade, the portable version remains enjoyable with a huge amount of content and a sufficiently solid frame rate.                            
80	                                Dying Light: Platinum Edition for the Switch is a straightforward port of a solid game. The basic zombie-killing parkour adventure is still as fun as it was when the game was originally released, and it has only received more content and more things to kill since then. The Switch version runs surprisingly well, so if you're willing to compromise visuals for portability, it might be the game for you. Dying Light 2 might feel like it's eternally delayed, but the Switch version can help tide players over until they get the chance to finally return to the zombie-infested world of Dying Light.                            
80	                                Dying Light: Platinum Edition looks surprisingly good on Switch, and even more impressive is that load times are kept short and the framerate stable. So, with a journey to Harran being as captivating today as it was in 2015, there’s no reason why those who love exploring open worlds filled with zombies wouldn’t want to pick this up. Add in a whole smorgasbord of additional content, features and modes, and you have a package that’s a highlight in the Switch’s extensive catalogue.                            
75	                                If you have never played Dying Light, this iteration isn’t the one I would recommend for you BUT if you are already a hardcore fan, then adding this to the Switch for playing on the go is a fun challenge and I definitely recommend it.                            
75	                                Overall, Dying Light: Platinum Edition does a lot quite well on Switch. Aside from some technical hiccups and a pretty insignificant narrative, the game shines behind a satisfying gameplay loop with buildings to climb, upgrades to snag, and zombies to smack. With loads of packed-in DLC content and a few multiplayer modes piled on top of a sizable base game, fans of the gameplay loop will find dozens of hours of gratifying zombie-crushing entertainment. Ahead of a sequel set to arrive in February, the game does little to push genre limits or set new standards, but it’s an easy recommendation for fans of open-world titles, fun gameplay, and zombies.                            
70	                                Well, this isn't the prettiest version of this underrated gem, but the port itself is well-made and plays nice (mostly). This is a well made port and worthy of this great game.                            
70	                                I’m pretty glad I waited for Dying Light: Platinum Edition to come to Nintendo Switch to play it. I’m sure this game is much better elsewhere, there’s no doubt this is the “weakest” version to play. But when the weakest version of a game is still this good? That’s impressive.                            
70	                                While Dying Light doesn't win many awards for originality, it more than makes up for it with satisfying gameplay that will please even the most established zombie hunters.                            
65	                                Dying Light: Platinum Edition is another impressive Switch port, but the game itself is just OK. Its design threw everything at the wall, often to its detriment. While it has some pretty high highs, they lie almost exclusively in the movement. If you do want to chase those highs you’re better off on other platforms until another patch or two comes along.                            
100	                                Tales of Arise is not only now my favorite Tales game to date, even surpassing my beloved Vesperia, it’s easily in my top 3 JRPG’s of all time, deserving to be compared to and alongside the best of the genre, and hands down my Game of the Year pick for 2021 without any hesitation. A compelling and complex story, wonderful character development, addictive combat, plenty of side activities to partake in like fishing or farming, stunning visuals and perfect audio are just a few reasons I can’t recommend it enough. Tales of Arise was an unforgettable masterpiece that I’ll surely play through again on NG+ eventually and anyone that’s a JRPG fan needs to play, the sooner the better.                            
95	                                Tales of Arise is the perfect revamp for the saga after its 25th anniversary. A more accessible title for JRPG lovers, with surprising characters and story.                            
94	                                Tales of Arise is one of the great adventures of 2021 with a bold, fresh take on the series, but one that stays true to many of the series' fundamentals. Spectacular and fun gameplay meets a deep story with all sorts of characters that will win you over in a big way.                             
93	                                Tales of Arise is a JRPG that ticks a lot of boxes of what I expect and what I want such a game to be. It has a great story, great characters, wonderful designed areas that are vibrant and a combat system you can tailor to your preference. It proves not every RPG needs to be open world and if you do all the other elements very well then it makes for a great experience.                            
90	                                Tales of Arise is great at almost everything it attempts, but it does just falls short of having the wow factor and possesses a couple of niggling factors to boot. Nevertheless it’s absolutely worth picking up if you’re after an action-RPG to sink a load of hours into.                            
90	                                Tales of Arise is today the highest peak ever reached by the Bandai Namco franchise.                            
88	                                The real test of whether or not Tales of Arise is for you will be in your desired level of investment, because the requirement for here, is nothing shy of massive. But what you get is a charming game built from tentpole JRPG, anime and manga tropes, glammed up the wazoo, and pegged down with a solid fighting and combat system, stunning animations, a unique art-style and maybe the best presentation in the series yet. I for one loved my time with the game, even at its cringiest, because the payoff for growth in power and the game’s pure characterisation is worth watching the handful of Alphen skits being a big dumb idiot.                            
88	                                Tales of Arise proposes new ideas for a long-lived series where we thought we had already seen it all. After this, the franchise can no longer go back to what it was before. Because of its story that touches sensitive topics, improvement in art direction, and a more complex battle system, Arise stands next to Symphonia as one of the best games in the series. This is an adventure that you will remember for years.                            
87	                                For its 25th anniversary of the franchise, Tales of Arise doesn't only get a new exciting look, but the action RPG also delights with a dark, mature setting and presentation.                             
85	                                Tales of Arise succeeds in giving the series new lustre with a mature, interesting story full of twists, a technical aspect that is suited to the current generation and a dynamic, fast and spectacular combat system. There is still room for improvement, but if you are a fan of action-RPG it is a game not to be missed.                            
85	                                Tales of Arise brilliantly succeeds in breathing new life into the Tales Of saga. With its universe and its successful characters, the title delivers a striking adventure that takes advantage of superb environments thanks to a unique graphic rendering. The fights are not left out either since they show great intensity with always more spectacle, sometimes even if it means confusing the action. If we can blame it for his clipping, its talkative side, or its redundant bestiary, we still salute its many qualities which suggest good for the future of the series.                             
85	                                Tales of Arise is the return of a mythical saga that has not always been able to convince players, but that has taken its five-year break calmly enough to give us what will be one of the most outstanding JRPG titles of the year and a more than solid game for those who want to discover the saga. A title that hooks you with its plot, fulfills its combat and makes you fall in love with the relationships between characters.                            
80	                                Tales of Arise is a Japanese role-playing game of classic proportions. A motley crowd of young heroes sets out to save a world filled with of secrets, beautiful cities, fun battles, and an exciting story. The presentation is uneven, as is the plot - and the gameplay feels a bit too familiar. But for anyone who wants a grand and often beautiful Japanese role-playing game, Tales of Arise is one of the best.                             
70	                                The game’s incredibly refined, real-time combat is complemented by the social lessons and warnings imparted by the story. At least for half of its campaign.                             
70	                                Tales of Arise is an experience with good sides and bad sides. On one hand it is a great adventure in expansive and gorgeous environments, with a stellar action oriented combat system that might be the series best one so far. On the other hand the story – while interesting – is told in a really frustrating manner, with way toO much dialogue that has no real place or purpose.                            
100	                                Add in absolutely stunning visuals, and you have one of the finest adventure games of 2021. Guardians of the Galaxy is everything you could want in a Marvel video game, really, filled with a blend of electric moments and thoughtful junctures.                            
95	                                Guardians of the Galaxy is a strong contender for Game of the Year in 2021. Constantly, the game surprises with its inventive use of the Marvel formula. Eidos-Montreal has managed to do the impossible, creating a vision for the Guardians that isn’t beholden to the Marvel Cinematic Universe and can stand on its own. Featuring rich dialog and a character- and personality-driven story, players will be able to forge their own path as Star-Lord, leading his ragtag group of miscreants across the universe. Combat may not offer many surprises but is explosive and fast-paced enough to allow for exciting tactical teamwork. Guardians of the Galaxy has set a new standard for games based on comics and while there may be competition in the future, this game proves the genre can evolve to new heights.                            
95	                                While I went into Guardians with a good feeling I’d enjoy it, I was surprised by just how much fun I ended up having. Moreso than the combat gameplay or even the stunning world design, what really cemented my enjoyment was its writing.                            
95	                                Eidos Montreal has crafted one of the best superhero games. Their attention to world-building and characterization should be followed by many studios to come. Exciting combat that blends action RPG elements with strategic player commands and breathtaking visuals and animations is something to behold. But what truly sets this title apart is the fantastic writing, not just for the Guardians themselves but for every character you come across. If you weren't a fan of the franchise before, Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy might just change your mind.                            
95	                                Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy is a flarkin fantastic game; it's easily the best game of the year so far. My only disappointment? We need more Lipless.                            
92	                                Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy is the purest form of chaos; but also of good storytelling. It is a journey, not with mere NPCs alongside Peter Quill, but with real friends. It is also a full display of crazy explosions, action to get your blood pumping, hilarious jokes and sublime music. All in all, Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy is one of the best single-player experiences of 2021.                             
92	                                Despite a few technical hiccups, Guardians of the Galaxy is one of 2021's best games thanks to a fantastic story with amazing gameplay to boot. These Guardians really stand out from the movies even though they might similar. In many ways, Eidos has created Uncharted in space but with deeply satisfying combat mechanics that keep you entertained throughout.                            
91	                                As great as Marvel’s Avengers was, Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy takes the framework of combat there and fine-tunes it.                             
91	                                Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy is such a redemption after the disaster with Marvel's Avengers. Amazing gameplay, great story and stunning graphics, are some elements that makes the new Eidos game a must-have.                             
90	                                Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy is a surprise to be sure, but a welcome one. I’ve had zero expectations for this game since the preview trailers were so boring and bland, but the game itself is a whole different story. The amazing script was brought to life with excellent voice acting and all stuffed into some incredible and fun gameplay with captivating characters, quips, jokes and set pieces. Gardeners of the Galaxy is now a contender on my GOTY list.                             
90	                                Guardians of the Galaxy vs. Avengers? The latter doesn't stand a chance. On the one hand, I should encourage you to buy GotG and send a clear message to the overlords that gamers still love single-player stories. On the other hand, I wish Eidos had spent this time making a third Deus Ex. Still, I had tons of fun with the Guardians, and I'd like to see a sequel.                            
90	                                Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy surprises with a remarkable, true and emotional story with excellent performances, all in a unique graphic style, full of effects and color that give strength to the game and above all to its message. The gameplay is not at the level of everything else that is presented, but that doesn't make it a truly negative element. An ode to books, movies and fans, with a team that goes back to giving it all, something that the player won't forget, taking us to moments of laughter and sadness like no other Marvel game has ever done.                            
90	                                Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy is an extremely fun little romp that is genuinely funny and heartfelt. It's fun to play, and combat maintains the feel of a team working together despite being technically only a single-player game. The only real downside is that it is a linear game, so the replay value depends on how much you enjoy seeing alternate outcomes to various cut scenes. If you're a fan of the franchise and don't mind that this doesn't matching the MCU version, then there's a whole lot to like in MGotG.                            
90	                                There’s some frequent but minor performance issues aside. Be that as it may, Guardians of the Galaxy is one of the most enjoyable games you’ll play all year. You might have never gotten into one of the comics or films. Still, there’s something in this space-adventure epic for everyone. You could wait until the last of the technical creases are ironed out, but none ruin the core experience. If you’re looking for a game that’s brimming with heart in both story and gameplay, this is one for you.                            
90	                                Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy is an excellent story-driven game with compelling characters, nice humor, great narrative and amazing visuals.                            
90	                                Eidos Montréal gives us one of the most interesting narrative games of recent times, always taking advantage of the medium's own tools to narrate. Knowledge and affection for the characters, entertaining combat, incessant surprises... one of the best of the year.                            
90	                                Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy takes the action RPG and draws from both the films and comics to create a stunning gaming experience. With plenty of humor, an amazing soundtrack, and stellar gameplay, this is one of the best team-based comic book games ever.                            
90	                                It turns out that Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy shouldn’t have been written off. Eidos Montreal delivers a strong story filled with comedy and tragedy, great characters and a world that feels entirely unlike the Marvel Cinematic Universe. They’ve compiled a lengthy adventure that’ll take players to new and familiar locations and built out a great gameplay system that utilizes all the Guardians’ best attributes.                            
90	                                Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy is simply one of the most satisfying superhero action/adventure games we've played recently. A great story, hilarious gameplay and excellent technical achievement make the new work of Eidos Montréal one of the best games of the year.                            
90	                                Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy is the biggest surprise of the year, and joins Marvel’s Spider-Man as one of the best Marvel video games in the last decade. The Guardians themselves steal the show, depicted perfectly, with a movie/comic-worthy story that will leave you laughing and crying. The combat is a lot of fun with plenty of strategies to use, even if it can get a little repetitive, and the setting and locations blow you away in scale and how incredibly detailed and beautiful they are. This Guardians team absolutely stands on its own, and just like the movie I’m hooked on a feeling.                            
89	                                Although over the decades comics have become ever more reflective of the complexities and concerns of contemporary life, in the end, they are still often the literary or cinematic equivalent of fast food: momentarily delicious, exactly what you need to fill the void, but not necessarily memorable or nutritious. Guardians of the Galaxy isn’t afraid of touching on some weighty themes, but they’re always secondary to an absorbing story, entertaining characters, and engaging action. Guardians of the Galaxy isn’t perfect, but overall, it’s a very effective translation of Marvel’s iconic band of misfits from page or screen into interactive entertainment.                            
88	                                Guardians of the Galaxy is fun to play because it has fun with itself. It’s clever, fast-paced, and never takes itself seriously. In other words, it’s the kind of game the Guardians of the Galaxy deserve.                            
88	                                Marvel Guardians of the Galaxy aims high and hits the target perfectly by delivering a thoroughly enjoyable single-player action RPG as you control Star Lord and his his motley alien crew while kicking ass along the way. It’s immaculately presented on the PlayStation 5 with graphics that pop and a soundtrack that will even make director James Gunn envious! So if you’re looking for the perfect alien superhero getaway, Marvel Guardians of the Galaxy hits that bullseye perfectly.                            
87	                                Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy is a fun game, very well-planned, with great narrative and strong ambitions to entertain the player. Star-Lord's interaction with the Milano crew and the rest of the characters is magical. Combat and physics can be problematic, but the errors don't overshadow the positives. Even the Latin American dubbing is a delight that you are sure to enjoy.                            
87	                                Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy is a blast for its entire run of 20-plus hours, and when it’s not entertaining you with goofy banter and situations, it’s aiming directly at your heart. The twitchy combat is like strapping a high-class hyperdrive engine to a well-worn ship held together with duct tape and bubblegum: it’s such a wild ride that you won’t even notice when it falls apart. Though the fighting has its issues, it’s decent enough to ferry you through the wonderfully dynamic story. For Guardians fans, this game is a no-brainer. But even if you’re not into the superhero thing, it’s also the grandest space opera game this side of Mass Effect. Between Guardians and Avengers, could we be headed for a Square Enix Cinematic Universe? If so, Guardians of the Galaxy may not be a final destination, but at least the spaceship knows which way to go. I’ll be hooked on a feeling for a while.                            
87	                                Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy is a solid action adventure that fans of this group of heroes will love. Although it is not surprising in its approach, it does many things well and manages to redeem itself in the eyes of lovers of the Marvel universe.                            
86	                                Blasting combat gameplay that merges very well with the single player concept without loosing the sense of being part of a team. Humor and drama draws an engaging story very focused on The Guardians of the Galaxy.                            
86	                                Marvel's: Guardians of the Galaxy is a fantastic game. He knows what his greatest virtues are and he performs them without showing off. Square Enix has found a path that it can and must explore, using the most popular and interactive medium, to shape its comic book universe wherever it can.                            
85	                                It’s been a rocky road for Marvel properties in videogames, but Guardians of the Galaxy stands out as one of the very best. The combination of likable characters and fantastic scenery make for a game that’s an absolute blast to play for the entire duration. It’s got great style and a big heart, and really, that’s kinda what Guardians of the Galaxy as a franchise is all about. Eidos Montreal should be congratulated on an excellent adventure, and Square-Enix should be commended for letting them make it while locking the upselling bean counters in a broom closet.                            
85	                                Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy is a game with a lot of quality, but it is far from perfect. However, it is a product by a team that fulfilled their mission of providing a sincere and heartfelt game. It is well worth giving it a chance.                            
85	                                Guardians of the Galaxy offers a great gaming experience: fun story, good combat, good characterization and well done VA.                            
85	                                Guardians of the Galaxy is a spectacular, albeit lengthy adventure with enjoyable mechanics and a surprisingly deeper story than what is on the surface.                            
85	                                Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy is a damn great, roughly 30-hour experience that anyone can enjoy regardless of their history with any content from Marvel's extensive catalog. While combat can be effortless, it's rarely dull with clear effort poured into every imaginable corner. Character scenes are full of fun moments of dialogue but still manage to feature some emotional story beats enhanced by the cast. Looking past my critiques, I had a joyous time with Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy, and I hope it gets the praise it deserves.                            
85	                                Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy is pure blockbuster entertainment in much the same way as the MCU films. It might not push any boundaries in the genre, but it's a damned good Guardians game with a ton of heart and a clear passion for the property that shows. Eidos Montreal has clearly understood the strengths of its team and how they fit in with what fans love about the franchise to make the right calls. The result is an enjoyable ride and the most Marvel Marvel game around.                            
85	                                Guardians of the Galaxy is everything that Marvel's Avengers should have been, offering players a single-player focused adventure with some of your favorite comic book characters. Mixed in with solid gameplay and continuous witty banter between your teammates, Guardians of the Galaxy will leave you already excited for what you would expect to be the inevitable sequel.                            
85	                                Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy is primarily filled with hilarity. The dialogue is expertly written, which fleshes out the characters like never before. The dynamic that this creates between the titular Guardians is more than enough to keep you chained to your screen for upwards of 20 hours.                            
85	                                Guardians of the Galaxy sets a new high bar for interactive storytelling and jaw-dropping visuals. With an unparalleled attention to detail, Guardians tells a rollicking sci-fi story rooted in true human emotion. But the gameplay sections of this narrative masterpiece sometimes bog down the proceedings with merely "okay" combat and exploration.                            
84	                                An adventure full of twists, with splendid dialogue and all the verve of the Guardians of the Galaxy. Perfect for supergroup fans and a good title to entertain everyone else.                             
83	                                I’m a simple man (not in game), give me a comic interpretation made by people who appreciate and understand the source material and tell a captivating story and you’ve got me hooked. There’s not much to do outside of the bit of collectibles and costumes after you beat the game but maybe if Guardians does well enough we’ll see some strong DLC content. Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy is built to be a holiday season blockbuster (I mean is anything else even coming out this holiday?), and all of its accessibility options make it the perfect gift for anyone.                            
83	                                Guardians Of The Galaxy is exactly what you want from a game in this franchise. Full of laughs, engaging action, and an epic, galaxy-spanning plot that hooks you from moment one.                            
81	                                Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy provides a fun action adventure with small gameplay weaknesses for fans.                            
80	                                Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy has its flaws, but it's probably one of the best games in the Marvel universe beside Insomniac's Spider-Man in recent years.                            
80	                                Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy is one of the most fun games this year. Its linear storytelling provides the right story that goes all on in the cosmic enjoyment. Add in the fantastic spectacles with a kicking soundtrack, and this game will make you yell flark yes!                            
80	                                Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy is blissfully freeing in a way that not many shooters are these days.                            
80	                                This take on Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy puts a premium on character and storytelling, with surprisingly impressive results.                            
80	                                Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy is a good superhero game. It may not be the best out there, but it is in the top 5. If you are a true Marvel fan familiar with the Guardians of the Galaxy universe it hits the perfect notes in almost perfect order. It tried to balance the videogames gameplay with a cinematic experience, focusing on delivering a quality single player experience. It does not miss the multiplayer or co-op experience at all, and you can feel that it was made with care. Guardians of the Galaxy makes us forget about the grindy gameplay of Avengers and proves that Square Enix can deliver an engaging experience.                            
80	                                Guardians of the Galaxy shines when it focuses on the characters and the world around them. It might not be the most innovative game this year, but it excellently executes the tried-and-true linear action-adventure formula to deliver a great single-player experience.                            
80	                                With a solid script, robust soundtrack, and plethora of expertly delivered lines, it’s obvious a lot of care was put into making Guardians of the Galaxy feel like you were playing through an interactive movie. Its gameplay choices won’t win any awards, but the magic it makes with its witty lines and casual banter succeed in inviting you into its strange, goofy, and striking world.                            
80	                                Regardless of how synonymous the characters now are with their big-screen depictions, this version of the Guardians of the Galaxy is far and away my favourite. The exceptionally well-written story is backed by a cast of unique and complex characters whose interactions with each other are equally hilarious and heartfelt. The fun and frantic combat may take some warming to, but the reliance on team synergy is thematically rewarding and visually impressive. Looking past the few technical issues and outdated exploration, this is an action game that will appeal to comic fans and gamers alike.                            
80	                                With its endearing characters and effective humor, Guardians of the Galaxy is one of the pleasant surprises of the end of the year, which is obviously aimed at a very large audience. Behind this careful writing, we feel a deep love on the part of the developers of Eidos Montreal for its marginalized space. And if the adventure is not as epic as we hoped, the journey is nonetheless pleasant with its moments of complicity and the many choices offered which reinforce the player's involvement. A truly attractive journey, in particular thanks to an efficient and fluid combat system which nevertheless shows its limits at the end of the game and against the bosses. Finally, it is more on its visual part that the title can divide. If we find on the one hand original environments and neat character models, we also note the presence of less convincing facial animations in places and sometimes less fine landscapes. It is nonetheless a gripping adventure alongside the galaxy's greatest magnificent losers that has plenty to please MCU fans.                             
80	                                Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy is a fun-filled cosmic adventure. No aggressive microtransactions, no tacked on multiplayer, just a good ol’ fashioned single-player adventure with MCU-worthy blockbuster sequences and heartfelt story moments. The combat offers just enough variance and depth to remain entertaining throughout your playthrough but the magic truly resides within the colorful cast of characters.                            
80	                                After stumbling out the gate with last year’s Avengers, Square Enix has managed to steady the ship with Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy. For the story alone, the game is well-worth playing, but it’s the abundance of lore, well-written dialogue and gorgeous locales that elevate it as one of the best Marvel games to date. If the game’s combat bore a tad more finesse, and if some of the glitches had been ironed out before launch then Guardians would be more in line with the quality we’ve seen from Marvel’s Spider-Man, but the game has shown that Square Enix can make the most of the license when steered in the right direction. I’m now very excited to see what the company can do next.                            
80	                                All of these elements combine to create a game that is a jack of all trades, and master of none, but that’s a happy outcome considering how many different things it tries to do. A lot of what I’ve described so far probably sounds like a mashup of several different things that other games arguably do better, but Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy does everything with so much heart and charm that it overcomes some of the elements feeling a little empty and results in one of the best gaming adventures I’ve been on in 2021. Considering how much of a let-down the previous big Marvel game was, I am more than happy to shout how great this is without any conditions put on top.                             
80	                                It’s not quite up there with the PS5’s superlative Spider-Man Marvel game, that’s another level of awesome. But there’s plenty of old-school singleplayer adventure here to get you through those chilly Autumn nights until the next big Marvel movie hits the silver screen.                            
80	                                Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy gave us positive vibes from the moment we set foot on Milan. A solid gunplay, the importance assigned to the cooperation between the protagonists and the phenomenal script lead us to widely approve Eidos Montréal's fresh and original vision of the precious license of the House of Ideas. However, there are some reserves of a technical and playful nature, accompanied by a fairly limited level of customization. Whether or not you are a die-hard fan of the most ramshackle supergroup in the Multiverse, let yourself be enchanted by the extravagant style and personalities of the Guardians of the Galaxy, and set off with them for the stars.                             
80	                                Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy is exactly what a fan would want from a Guardians of the Galaxy tie-in. In the game you can only control Star-Lord, but the adventure developed by Eidos Montreal boasts a brilliant script, which effectively exploits the dynamics that made the movies so successful.                            
80	                                Despite some initial skepticism that they could pull it off, Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy is everything I want a Guardians of the Galaxy game to be. It is character-focused first and foremost, retaining the comedic heart and ’80s vibe that is core to the franchise. As a single-player game, it doesn’t get bogged down by expectations of some kind of grind or endgame. While combat can sometimes be rather chaotic and there are a few bugs, Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy understands what Guardians of the Galaxy is—character, comedy, and heart.                            
80	                                Eidos-Montreal’s Guardians of the Galaxy is brilliant, but the one thing holding me back from giving it a higher score is how dated many of its conventions seem. The power cooldown has no plan B, QTEs are everywhere, and again… Eagle Vision. It’s a few years behind the times, even without George Michael's dulcet tones. It’s fun, but it certainly isn’t fresh, and for a lot of people, that will be enough. In some ways, it's an experience not to be missed. In others, it's an experience you've had before.                            
80	                                I suppose we can now venture into the old “is Guardians worth $60?” debate. If you miss hyper linear story games with no live service BS, and are a big Marvel fan, then this might be the game for you. If you are hoping for Devil May Cry level combat and God of War type puzzles and exploration within a linear story, you will be disappointed. But I can safely say this is probably a better end product than most people were expecting, and that alone is a pretty big win for a game that felt like a bit of a risk and like it’s been lacking in buzz leading up to launch here. It has issues, but it gets a lot right, and pushes storytelling in ways I haven’t seen in this genre before.                            
80	                                It’s hard not to love Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy. Yes, I wish there was more scope for open exploration, and I wish some of the combat encounters were a little more varied. But there’s a ridiculous amount of heart here. From an absolutely killer soundtrack to brilliantly-written characters that you can’t help but adore, it’s a rip-roaring adventure through space that left me wanting more. Ultimately, it’s one of Marvel’s best video game outings yet.                            
80	                                Even if you’re fatigued by the endless amount of Marvel content, Guardians of the Galaxy shows a lot of heart and soul. The cast delivers unforgettable performances that are further highlighted by meaningful exploration and impactful narrative decisions. The adventure loses a bit of steam the longer it goes, due to overly familiar combat, but the team’s banter keeps things entertaining. Eidos Montreal has delivered a memorable and intimate take on the team of misfits that truly stands on its own.                             
80	                                Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy might be by-the-numbers, but it's a consistently enjoyable experience with great characters and an engaging story, thanks to an excellent understanding of what makes this property tick.                            
80	                                I really didn't expect to enjoy Guardians of the Galaxy as much as I did. The game's marketing left me incredibly lukewarm, and I wasn't sure what to expect, even after the first couple of hours with the game. What I found, however, is one of the best stories of the entire year. There's definitely a bit of tedium packed into the overall experience, but Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy is an adventure well worth taking, warts and all.                             
80	                                Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy nicely balances a goofy, action-filled adventure with some genuinely heartfelt story moments, and the choices you’re given can add some surprising personal twists to your particular playthrough. Its combat and level design are relatively simple if still consistently entertaining, but it’s the relationships and banter between its characters that keep everything fresh as they evolve. It isn’t going to set the world on fire, but Guardians of the Galaxy is still another convincing example of how much fun a linear, no-frills, single-player campaign can be.                            
80	                                For as much uncertainty there has been surrounding Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy, the final game has delivered. Fun and frantic combat provide the basis for a long, extremely enjoyable campaign featuring the characters you love and the tracks your kids usually screw their noses up at. A great title that deserves to be expanded upon in the future.                            
80	                                Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy is a bit rough around the edges, but it's so fun to play, with a well-written and exciting story.                            
80	                                If Guardians of the Galaxy had Returnal’s combat and traversal, it would be a real Game of the Year contender, but it’s the few mechanical flaws that hold it back.                            
80	                                A surprisingly ambitious cosmic space adventure that excels the more it diverges from the movies, offering robust action, impressive visuals, and unexpectedly sophisticated storytelling.                            
80	                                Marvel's Guardian of the Galaxy brings you a fun entertaining adventure, where the emphasis is on the development of the various characters. This can be called successful and the gameplay plays both with exploration, which is very nice, and with combat. This is somewhat limited however, because the game lacks depth in terms of combat. Graphically it is also not perfect, but it must be said that visually it looks very neat thanks to the artistic style. This makes Guardians of the Galaxy a successful game that is definitely worth it for Marvel fans.                            
80	                                Square Enix and Eidos Montreal don't exactly pull this job off flawlessly. In fact, it gets ugly at points. Yet, oddly enough, that feels very appropriate for Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy.                            
80	                                Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy is a good game that wants to be, in Peter Quill's words, metal. It doesn't quite reach that mark, but compared to other recent Marvel video games that aren't Spider-Man, it succeeds more often than it fails. If you've liked other incarnations of the team's lovable misfits and misanthropes, you'll like what the developers have done here. And even if you're only somewhat aware of its Marvel background, there's a lot to love already here that a fresh coat of bug-fixing polish will only make better.                            
80	                                Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy delivers superhero thrills and genuine heart with an engrossing story, lovable characters, and fun (if predictable), gameplay...Despite control issues and occasionally holding it back, Eidos-Montréal crafted a game that prevails more than it falters. While it doesn’t break any new ground, like some of the MCU's entries, it still feels like time well spent with its characters.                            
80	                                Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy may not be able to quite match the humor of James Gunn’s MCU films, but it’s packed with plenty of personality and decently fun (if not groundbreaking) combat. To its great credit, Eidos-Montréal’s story-driven approach always keeps the focus on its ragtag team of heroes, making for a worthwhile and memorable trip to the Cosmic Marvel universe.                            
80	                                Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy tells an utterly memorable story, with brilliant takes on the Guardians themselves, even if the gameplay could be more adventurous at times.                            
75	                                Guardians of the Galaxy is a competent, if not especially electrifying, action game that sails along on the back of strong voice acting and the sheer momentum with which it introduces new scenes and charismatic characters.                            
75	                                Marvel’s Guardians Of The Galaxy is more than pleasant surprise. Even when its combat system doesn't shine, everything is saved by a completely charming story and cast.                            
73	                                Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy offers some great dialogue, strong characters and occasionally interesting story choices. The gameplay is serviceable, and it could have used a bit more polish, but it's being in the company of these self-proclaimed good guys that you'll be most interested in.                            
73	                                Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy leaves an outstanding first impression but after playing it for a handful of hours, you'll realise that it doesn't really offer enough exciting gameplay to last its entire campaign. It's still a wonderful game to watch, though.                            
70	                                Where Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy proves most winsome, however, is in its twining of the intergalactic and the terrestrial.                            
70	                                Clever writing, fun gameplay and a deeply charming cast of characters goes a long way, but Guardians of the Galaxy is otherwise a tad too long, too noisy and too unpolished.                            
70	                                Guardians of the Galaxy by Eidos Montreal ends up becoming an even better Guardians story than the two blockbuster films combined.                            
70	                                Guardians of the Galaxy is a solid original story from Eidos Montreal that deviates from both the MCU and the comics, providing something for Marvel fans across mediums to enjoy. However, while it’s certainly a step up from publisher Square Enix’s Avengers, it suffers with its own notable bugs and glitches that detract from the on-screen action. The day one patch will hopefully tackle these problems, and if so this is a highly recommendable superhero game that doesn’t quite step it up like Insomniac’s Spider-Man series, though still does right by its unlikely group of misfit anti-heroes.                            
70	                                Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy has some rough edges, but its solo team play mechanics are a perfect match for the dysfunctional superhero family.                            
70	                                Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy absolutely nails the vibe and look, even if the middling story, technical issues, and repetition hold it back from being truly great.                            
70	                                Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy doesn't feature an engaging combat system, save for the moments where the team huddles provide a loose connection to the much more engaging narrative theme of the strength of communication. The game instead shines via its storytelling, which is enhanced by a talented collection of voice actors and a wonderful soundtrack. If this game is your introduction to the titular heroes, it's not the best first impression, but sometimes when the galaxy needs to be saved, you can settle for good enough.                            
70	                                Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy as a video game is a bit simple and repetitive, but still, it offers a funny, often moving, epic musical adventure with a smart Telltale-like narration.                            
70	                                At the end of the day, Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy is everything I wanted it to be. There’s classic Guardians snark, bickering, and epic fight scenes scored with tunes from my youth. It just needs a little more polish to make it really sing.                            
70	                                Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy is a fun trip across the galaxy alongside comics' most famous motley crew. Eidos Montreal totally nailed the tone of this one and it's a pleasure to watch and hear the team evolve over time. The game's dialogue is very well written with some genuinely funny lines (and great voice acting). All the while telling a touching story. We just wish the game's combat would have been a bit more inspired and polished.                            
70	                                Much like the characters themselves, Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy is a really funny mish-mash of ideas and concepts with some working better than others. At its best, the campaign is strong with well-produced cinematic cutscenes, likable characters, gorgeous environments and an action romp that excites when everything is in sync. On the flipside, the pacing of combat stops things from getting into a solid rhythm until later in the game, and I much preferred my time solving puzzles or platforming while enjoying the epic story. When so much of your journey will be spent in combat, that’s a bit of a shame. Despite some quirks, Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy is a super-fun superhero adventure that hits more than it misses, with a banging soundtrack and a lot of personality that more than makes up for its shortcomings.                            
65	                                Guardians of the Galaxy coasts by quite a bit on personality, and that's definitely going to make it divisive.                            
60	                                It gets the tone and characters right enough that Marvel-heads will want to see this story 6through, but make someone else play it while you munch popcorn. [Issue#8, p.78]                            
60	                                Simplistic, repetitive interactions drag on an otherwise engaging story based on the Marvel franchise.                            
60	                                Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy is actually better when you’re not playing it: everything it does to get you onside with its quippy humour, its sharp story-telling, and its endearing characters, it loses in clunky, laborious combat, some appalling pacing, and baffling design decisions. It’s a damn shame that one of the best stories of the year – with some seriously impressive voice work and mo-cap – is tainted by a game that feels like it just doesn’t want to be played.                            
60	                                Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy is a great portrayal of the space-faring heroes and a good game. We encountered some annoying bugs that are hopefully alleviated with patches, and it's pretty linear, but this is an interstellar romp that you can enjoy across a few evenings.                            
100	                                Incsryption is a deck-building roguelike game with a great metafiction scenario. Even the deck-building and roguelike elements are just part of what this game makes you think it is, as the game’s structure keeps changing as you progress. This continuous change of style makes you feel like you're playing a very special game, and it will keep you excited throughout the experience.                            
100	                                Inscryption is full of charm, humour, and a healthy dose of mystery. Forget what you think you know about this game, it’s so much more.                            
100	                                Go into Inscryption as unspoiled as possible, and trust in the game. You will find a deeply enjoyable card game, wrapped in a series of dark mysteries, wrapped in…well…other stuff. Part CCG game, part escape room puzzle game, and part bonkers gonzo whirlybird lunacy, Inscryption is one of the best games of the year. They should charge more for a game this good.                            
95	                                When I was first assigned this game for review, I thought that it might be just another card drawing and puzzle affair that seem to be common these days. However, Inscryption kept my attention until the very end. The plot, the dark theme, and the mysterious mechanics is so well thought out that I have to give it an enthusiastic two thumbs up. The only downside that I can think of is that replayability might be limited after the first couple of play throughs. Even with that said, this title is worth the price of admission.                            
95	                                Inscryption is a game that seeks to advance the medium, challenge the player and make him participate in something huge. This would be enough to consider it a great title, but on top of that it is brilliantly designed and the characters and story will not be easily forgotten                            
90	                                Inscryption is an oddity of the best order. It's a horror game that isn't aggressively trying to scare you. It's also a clever card system wrapped around a compelling mystery that plays with video game conventions. Like a bat out of hell, Inscryption came out of nowhere and quickly became one of my favorite games of the year.                            
90	                                Inscryption is a masterpiece. It combines rogue-like elements with card-based gameplay and brings with it with one of the best stories we’ve experienced in a long time. The only real criticism we have is the relatively short time it took us to beat the game. Nonetheless, Inscryption is one of the best games of the year, indie or otherwise.                            
90	                                Inscryption is a damn fun card game: a roguelite, a puzzle game and a story with horror tinges, and all of this is barely enough to describe what on balance are only the first hours of the experience. It is the consecration of Daniel Mullins and his idea of the code as a sentient and malignant entity that turns against the user, upsetting his role and his relationship with the game. A card game with a punk soul, developed by a developer with a punk soul and distributed by punks who have made subversive indie their trademark. An absolute triumph.                             
90	                                Inscryption, without a doubt, is one of the best indie games of 2021. In the indie scene, there are quite a few risky and unique projects, but few are also as fun in the most playful sense as Inscryption.                            
90	                                Inscryption is much more than a card game with a roguelike base and puzzle touches in an escape room setting. Without a doubt, it is one of the great surprises of this year 2021.                            
90	                                Inscryption is as consistently fun as it is surprising, with a wonderfully creepy story cleverly tying its ever-evolving mechanics together.                            
90	                                Inscryption is another great experience from Daniel Mullins and his studio. Their take on the already very crowded card game and rogue combination is a unique but recognizable one. I liked the combat, the level of complexity, the challenge posed by the bosses. And I loved the way it integrates with the wider world of the game and the story it tells. I would like to see more use for the sacrifice mechanic and some extra ways to cheat the rules. But self-aware creatures, cards that immortalize failed runs, and general creepiness add a lot to the core concepts. Inscryption has all the necessary ingredients to set a new standard of quality for its genre and keep fans engaged for tens of hours.                            
90	                                Inscryption is an amazingly well-put-together piece of work. The atmosphere presented…well, I’ve already doted on it multiple times. And I’ll do so again: it’s unsettling, occasionally oppressive, and always keeps the player on their toes. It could easily carry the work on its own, but luckily the card game mechanics are solid and sound as well. It’s easy to pick up, but with a ton of variables to allow customization and multiple viable approaches to the challenges provided. If only it didn’t stumble literally right at the finish line, I’d call this a near-perfectly designed game. Unfortunately, that last moment soured me on the experience…not enough render the whole thing moot (a la Mass Effect 3), but I just can’t shake it off. Despite that, Inscryption is a game that I can recommend highly. Even if you’re not typically a fan of deckbuilding games (just as I used to be), if you want some unsettling vibes for the season, this is your game right here.                            
90	                                Far more than a card game, Inscryption is a dark odyssey into an even darker narrative – commanding your attention in an exciting, gripping manner.                            
90	                                On the surface, Inscryption is described as a card game, but it hides a lot more than just cards under the bonnet. Prepare for a layered story, thrilling surprises, and terrifying yet fascinating characters that will keep you glued to your seat. The game masterfully expands on the story playthrough after playthrough, providing a fresh perspective with each run. In this sense, Inscryption is a great twist on the otherwise repetitive roguelike formula that has dominated the deckbuilder genre in the last few years. This, in addition to the strange storytelling we’ve come to expect from Daniel Mullins, makes for a gaming experience that is not to be missed for card game and narrative game fans alike.                            
90	                                Inscryption manages to combine an expertly-crafted card game, a nail-biting tale of horror and enjoyable escape room adventures into another genre-defying gem and easily one of the year’s best games. Whether you come for the gameplay and strategy, the story and atmosphere, or both, you’ll walk away awestruck at the sheer, brilliant madness you just experienced. Daniel Mullins does it again, and once again, we urge readers not to read the reviews or other coverage as much as possible and just go in blind, experiencing this twisted odyssey for yourself. You’ll be glad you did.                            
90	                                All in all, Inscryption is a great–and spooky–game that is constantly expanding and re-inventing itself, and I recommend it to anyone who loves horror. As long as you approach it with an open mind, a strong stomach, and the willingness to keep trying, you should have a great time with this title. Just remember: if you think the game is over in the first few hours, it’s time to hit the New Game button and see what you’ve unlocked.                            
90	                                With its dreary visuals and unsettling soundtrack, Inscryption offers a unique deck-building experience with added immersive puzzles. It creates an incredible atmosphere for a game with such a simplistic and dark design. Still, it delivers it in a memorable way, accessible to anyone who dare set out on the journey. In a world where roguelikes are daunting for some, this is one nightmare that I didn’t mind diving back into.                            
90	                                Fresh, intense and challenging without being complex; that's how we would define Inscryption. Mullins' adventure, published by Devolver Digital, is a card game but also an escape room. The card battles are fast, fun and extremely varied and in the background there is also an interesting, exciting, well-acted plot.                            
90	                                Inscryption is refreshingly unique. With all the roguelike deckbuilders popping up these days, they can all start to blend together. Inscryption manages to stand out from the crowd in all the best ways. Complex card strategies blend with escape room puzzles far better than should be possible. And the whole package is wrapped in such perfectly, wonderfully creepy trappings that it’s perfect for the Halloween season. Just remember: don’t ever assume you’ve reached the end.                            
88	                                This is a game unlike any other, that delivers one surprise after another, with plenty of twists to create an experience where nothing it what it seems.                            
86	                                Despite minimal flaws, Inscryption masters the experiment of blending acard game and horror into a bizarre mindtrip.                            
85	                                If Inscryption can repel some with its pixelated graphics and its purely textual dialogues, it fully assumes its old school side. And it is right to do so since its artistic direction is clearly convincing. As for the gameplay, it is full of creativity and offers us an adventure where the rules are constantly reinvented to surprise us each time in a particularly efficient way. Another little indie gem.                            
85	                                Dark, intriguing, compelling: Inscryption is an absolute must-play.                            
82	                                Inscryption combines roguelike mechanics with an oppressive and gloomy atmosphere that will terrorize you. Its strongest asset is in its narrative and artistic direction, although it falters when it comes to graphics.                            
80	                                Even if you feel extremely tired from the oversaturation of card-based games you should give Inscryption a change. Its fresh take on the genre offers an especially clever satire of the card-based motif and an overall experience that in the end feels like a well-crafted story-based game disguised as a roguelike. Its full story comes to an end at around 8 hours, but not before it provides a wealth of unexpected twists and turns in both its gameplay and presentation.                            
80	                                The first act is just brilliant. Not only is the core card game at its best, but it's also where those mechanics are best served by the richly atmospheric trappings surrounding them. The following two acts admirably offer new twists on the mechanics and a different perspective on the narrative, but neither prove as satisfying as the original. Alone, Act 1 is one of the best games of the year, but everything that comes after drags it back into the pack.                            
80	                                Developer Daniel Mullens returns with another strange meta-game about card games, games in general and player expectations. Astonishingly he once more succeeds in completely surprising us, which at this point isn't much of a surprise.                            
80	                                A work of devilish cleverness that’s both a mockery and celebration of collectible cards games and an increasingly disturbing horror story about the cost of victory.                            
80	                                Inscryption’s arrival in mid-October makes for a perfect Halloween game. What seems most vital for the game's success will be to casually get it to people who won’t know what to expect, like fans of deckbuilders just looking for another to add to their pile. Still, even if players go into Inscryption expecting the unexpected, there’s entertaining depth to its mechanics and narrative, a form of storytelling that could only exist in a video game.                            
80	                                Inscryption is a great creepy experience to get your skin crawling with some thought provoking depth in its gameplay.                            
80	                                Inscryption turned out to be a small surprise, an indie title that breaks the rules of card games offering players something more elaborate and exciting, by adding in a mixture of roguelite, puzzle and horror. A pity that the game has no voiceover: it would have made its particular setting feel even more alive.                            
80	                                Daniel Mullins has done it again! After Pony Island and The Hex, Inscryption is another strange and profoundly unique adventure that everyone should play. A roguelite card game which is also a narrative adventure, a puzzle game and a crazy thriller full of fascinating weirdness. [Eurogamer Recommended]                            
80	                                The game is an unholy hybrid of a roguelike deck-builder and first-person escape-room experience that reveals itself to be a grand reflection of and meditation on lives lived within a bubble.                            
77	                                Inscryption does a lot of things right. At the same time, the abundance of superfluous elements upsets the internal harmony of this game.                            
75	                                Overall, Inscryption probably feels more like a traditional videogame than his previous works, but it’s a more difficult experience, with much relying on one’s luck and the RNG. While I believe deckbuilder fans could be interested, this is likely of more interest to connoisseurs of weird or strange narratives. I’ll leave it at that since saying more would likely spoil the trick, and like any good magician, I’m guessing that Mullins is loath to have his secrets revealed so easily.                            
75	                                I was deeply absorbed until the game flipped for the first time, then I fell out of love. I reconciled before the end, but I was still left feeling like I played a few similar games of different quality. Maybe it was a good idea to change things up before it had the chance to grow stale, it’s just nothing gripped me as firmly as the first chapter.                            
75	                                Inscryption's twists and turns are hit-or-miss, but the game's oddities are worth experiencing for yourself.                            
75	                                Though uneven in its middle section, Inscryption is a clever and refreshing horror-adventure card game.                            
70	                                Were Inscription half as long, it would probably be twice the game. [Issue#365, p.114]                            
69	                                At its best when it's strangest, Inscryption doesn't know when to hold 'em and when to fold 'em.                            
100	                                Lost Judgment is nothing short of stunning. It's tightly-packed narrative never fails to enthrall, while its gameplay systems make navigating to each of its engrossing narrative beats an exciting experience in its own right.                            
100	                                If you exclusively follow the main narrative then you’ll find that in Lost Judgment, Ryu Ga Gatoku Studio has delivered something every bit as compelling and interesting as anything Raymond Chandler ever wrote. The central crime story is a riveting and often uncomfortably poignant reflection on society (and Japan’s legal system). If, on the other hand, you’re more interested in more Yakuza-style zany side-styles and a deep collection of highly playable mini-games, the Lost Judgment has you covered there, too. I can’t see how anyone could fail to love this game.                            
100	                                Building upon its predecessor in every conceivable way, Lost Judgment is a superb sequel that tells a story that will leave you asking yourself what justice means to you. It's a gripping thrill ride full of twists and turns that will keep you guessing until the very end. And even after the credits roll, the city streets will call you back for more with their countless distractions.                            
95	                                Lost Judgment is one of the best games in years with its superlative narrative, sublime combat, great soundtrack, plethora of side activities, and fantastic localization. This is easily one of Sega’s best.                            
95	                                An amazing murder mystery and conspiracy story is told through awesome gameplay in Lost Judgment. Smooth combat, amazing cities to explore and fun side quests will keep you coming back for more.                            
93	                                The detective gameplay still needs some work, and the plot stumbles a bit from time to time, but I have never been happier to dive back into this world, nor sadder to leave it once the game is finished.                            
93	                                Even if you do the minimum amount of side content and just stick with the main story as much as possible, you’re in for a long, interesting, and fun game. The story matter is heavy, though, and might tax some players into taking breaks more often than they might typically. To balance that, there is a lot of good humor and zaniness that you would expect from this studio, but also some endearing missions in the School Stories section where you do everything from lead a dance team, help engineer robots, box, join a motorcycle gang, and partake in a Virtua Fighter 5 tournament. Additionally, the changes that LJ has compared to the original are all positive, too — big new areas to explore, new gameplay elements in both the action and adventure portions of the experience, and yet the best parts of the original are carried over. Ultimately, this is an excellent game that I readily recommend.                            
91	                                Whether this is a first trip to Kamurocho or simply the latest of many, Lost Judgment is an engaging experience and hopefully not the last we see of Yagami Takayuki.                            
91	                                RGG Studio’s greatest strength is it’s writing and characters and Lost Judgment delivers in spades. Characters are fleshed out and their motives feel grounded and believable, but you will also meet plenty of wacky and memorable folks as well. You grow attached to the people you meet in Ijincho and when bad things happen you genuinely hope everyone escapes unscathed.                             
90	                                Lost Judgment isn’t some cheap knockoff. On the contrary - it really smartly expands on the story of Yagami the ex-lawyer and uses a beautiful Yokohama to its full potential. It’s full of action set-pieces and typical Japanese humour. The only downside? Its mechanics are a bit too familiar.                            
90	                                I’m not going to be subtle here. I loved this game. I can never walk away from any game in this franchise unsatisfied, and I feel that even with my nitpicks and misgivings that this is a worthy successor to what many have seen as an interesting distraction to the main series. Lost Judgment stands upon the shoulders of its forebears with ease, is a joy to play, tells an intimate story with a (mostly) deft hand, and knows how to value add with the best in the series. This is not only a great sequel, it’s also a great addition in any gamer’s library. Period. Saying this is a must buy is an understatement. It’s a shining example of what a great Yakuza game can be.                            
90	                                Lost Judgment is a fantastic success. It expertly builds on the foundation laid by the first game while also continuing to differentiate itself from the Yakuza franchise in smart ways. It’s still very much a Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio Joint, but their brawling mechanics have never been sharper, their graphics have never been better, and this is one of the strongest stories they’ve ever produced. It’s a no-brainer purchase for fans, and new players will find it surprisingly accommodating.                            
90	                                Lost Judgment is a big step forward, with many updates based on audience reception of the original title. Sega released a game that elevates the Judgment franchise to a whole new level.                            
90	                                One intriguing murder mystery, two Japanese cities, three great fighting styles, over a dozen addictive mini-games and countless side stories: that's Lost Judgment. Whether you're a Yakuza veteran or if this is your first RGG game, play it.                            
90	                                The compelling story makes this sequel worthwhile in its own right, and what complements this is the fantastic and varied gameplay. With plenty of content, Lost Judgment is well equipped to keep you entertained for a long time, and last but not least, we must not fail to mention the audio, which is top notch. The Dragon Engine however does show its age a little, but that's fine.                            
90	                                If there was a category for most improved sequel this year, I strongly believe Lost Judgment might be in the running for winning it. The game offered so many new, cool things to do throughout my 45 hours with it and somehow striked a fine, delicate balance between the goofy Yakuza spin-off you know and love and a spectacular crime drama that tackles difficult themes not seen often enough in games.                            
90	                                Those worried about where the tradition of Yakuza would stand following last year’s change in direction for the series should rest easy in just how well executed Lost Judgment truly is, from terrifically-written story to masterful gameplay.                            
90	                                Lost Judgment is yet another home run for RGG Studio. It boasts an engaging, jaw-dropping narrative with emotional mysteries connected within an immense web of interconnected conspiracies. Additionally, the game's bold nature in tackling darker themes that can sharply resonate with young adult audiences is remarkably well done. Add on the expected and addicting side activities, minigames, and varied gameplay loop, and you have a sequel that manages to establish its own sturdy identity coupled with non-intrusive elements of the past.                            
90	                                A fantastic action adventure that taps directly into the root DNA of the Yakuza franchise, Lost Judgment not only manages to simultaneously boast both the darkest and the goofiest storylines of any title in the series to date, but it also stuns the player with an absolute avalanche of hugely entertaining side quests and activities. More than that though, Lost Judgment also provides solace for those who found themselves turned off by the turn-based combat system that the mainline Yakuza series now seems to favour, while welcoming newcomers to one of the best new Japanese franchises of the last two decades.                             
90	                                Much like the flashy combat, the story also builds itself with significant momentum. It makes Lost Judgment a game that, in addition to being fun to play, really entices you to see it to its end.                            
90	                                Lost Judgment is a game that deals with incredibly important topics in a very serious way, while also staying true to the wacky nature of this and the Yakuza series. It is also a fantastic game with great combat and solid narrative, and anyone that is slightly interested in what it has to offer should give it a try.                            
90	                                With its excellent detective story, extremely likable characters, and welcome improvements to combat and investigation mechanics, Lost Judgment won't disappoint any fan of the original, of the Yakuza series, or anyone looking for a very mature story. The game doesn't try to shake up the original formula, which may definitely put some players off, but this is hardly a problem when quality is as high as it is in the latest game from Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio.                            
90	                                Lost Judgment takes what was good about Judgment and turns it into an even better game. The main story is riveting and all the side-stories are just as interesting in a wide variety of ways. The game shows a side of Japan that is rarely seen in video games. And it does it in a serious way that is even rarer. The silliness people have come to expect from a Yakuza game is off course here to add some levity. It is also hard to believe how much stuff the developers have managed to put in the game. There's all the side content seen in previous Yakuza games (except for the karaoke, which is sorely missed). And on top of that, they've added a handful of brand new activities and mini-games which all have their own mechanics. With Lost Judgment, the Takuya Kimura-led series already has its Yakuza 0.                            
89	                                A sequel overflowing with content, well-written and scripted, and with a varied, deep and satisfying combat system.                            
89	                                Lost Judgment adds new mechanics and minigames to the Yakuza formula, although it is still a conservative approach. We loved the story, the characters and the realistic streets of Kamurocho in Tokyo and Ijincho in Yokohama.                            
88	                                Lost Judgment is a high quality sequel. It’s fun to play, despite the few gameplay changes compared to its predecessor, and has a very engaging and well-acted story. There is never a moment of boredom when playing in the role of Takayuka Yagami, moving between Kamarucho and Yokohama in search of the truth, with a thousand doubts in mind, a thousand enemies to defeat and a thousand extra activities to try.                            
86	                                While Lost Judgement isn't a perfect sequel, it still lives up to its predecessor as it offers new refreshing gameplay mechanics alongside an engaging story.                            
86	                                Lost Judgment is an excellent sequel, capable of introducing several new features compared to the first episode of the series. Some do not hit the target, while stealth and platform sections often appear dull, but the third fighting style manages to add freshness.                            
85	                                Lost Judgement is a step up from the original in almost every way with improved pacing, a more polished combat engine and a laundry list of fun side activities to get lost in. If not for the pedestrian detective elements, this could’ve been a new classic in the genre, and despite its notable flaws, it is still a story well worth experiencing.                            
85	                                Lost Judgment challenges its predecessor. The Japanese drama nonetheless trips over an unfocused narrative and technical flaws.                            
85	                                This game’s biggest fault is that it has too much going on that detracts from the main plotline. I’m hoping Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio keeps taking risks with exploring gameplay outside of the Yakuza norm, and our next outing with Judgment (or another spinoff) will go further toward distinguishing itself as a unique property.                            
85	                                Lost Judgment is the most captivating, dramatic and transfixing story of the year, and that should be no surprise to fans of RGG Studio’s output.                            
85	                                The Lost Judgment is one of the finest works by Ryu Ga Gotoku studio yet; a mature title that pulls itself out of Yakuza's shadow and represents an engaging and dark story combined with some solid Japaneese-Style action adventure gameplay.                            
85	                                Lost Judgment is a subtle improvement on the original, and continues the fun of seeing the seedy sides of Kamurocho and Ijincho while staying mostly on the good side of the law. A new combat style combined with a few more tricks up Yagami-san’s sleeves provide more entertaining ways to dispatch or get the upper hand on enemies, and of course the usual slate of minigames offer a much-needed respite from the main campaign’s twisted story. It may tread a lot of the same ground as the previous game, but that is absolutely a good thing.                            
85	                                With this second episode, the Judgment series proves that it can perfectly complement the main Yakuza series, which has been turn-based since its seventh episode. Yagami's investigation in Seiryo High School is exciting and much better paced than the first episode, while the gameplay has been enriched enough to push us to comb all of Yokohama once again. However, street fights are still slow to start and some investigation sequences break the rhythm of the game on some occasions. However, if you want a dose of good humor with a dark and well-written detective story, you can go eyes closed.                            
85	                                Lost Judgment can best be described as The Yakuza Game With The High School. It's familiar and comfortable, and it's likely to please fans of the franchise who weren't thrilled with the JRPG style of the last game. The storyline is sometimes too grim even for a Yakuza title, and it plays things a bit safe, but it's still a darn fun experience. If this really is the Judgment spin-off's last entry, then it's a fitting send-off to the sub-franchise.                            
85	                                Ultimately, Lost Judgment is a great sequel, characterized by very inspired writing and a great dose of irreverence. A braver second chapter, more refined and extremely more elegant, which offers the possibility of being played by all those who have never had direct contact with the first episode or with the Yakuza saga. RGG Studio proves once again to be one of the most competent teams on the square, capable of diversifying the gameplay as few, giving full importance to the narrative component of their productions and deliberately omitting some technical details that are however irrelevant for the success of the project. Sure, maybe more could have been done with regards to exploiting the features of Dualsense, but this is more of a wasted opportunity than a real lack.                             
85	                                Lost Judgement is a small leap forward for the Yakuza spinoff series. While I would have expected a bit more from a sequel, what’s here is still just as enjoyable as the first game, if not more so. The highschool additions are a novel look at the often used Japanese setting, while still focusing on the crime drama and investigation fans love.                            
85	                                If you want to accuse a town mascot of robbery, befriend a bunch of street cats or infiltrate a ninja dojo, Lost Judgment is for you.                            
85	                                Lost Judgment is a brilliant detective story that explores controversial subject matters to express a clear message about societal issues. Whilst there is a possibility that this could evoke some painful childhood memories, the considerate telling and satisfying conclusions to stories make them easier to digest. Although the game's structure closely follows the path paved by its predecessors, Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio has refined and developed its conventions to create one of their finest releases to date.                             
85	                                In its culture-infused entirety, Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio’s eastern feature has something for everybody scattered around every Japanese street corner and Lost Judgement is also a great example of what a “next-generation” title should look like.                            
84	                                Lost Judgment is a perfect sequel. Its greatest virtue is a story that leaves us absorbed during the twenty hours that will take you to complete the main content.                            
83	                                Lost Judgment does justice — never better said — to the original title.                            
82	                                Lost Judgment is too easy and doesn't reach the high levels of storytelling RGG Studio is famous for, but it's nonetheless a great crime action drama you may want to play.                            
80	                                Lost Judgment is more of the same with some fine tuning, but there are no revolutionary updates. There are more activities than ever, but the interface is the very same. There is a more fluid a spectacular combat system, but the AI is just the same. The analysis of the environment for clues still feels underdeveloped, and the tailing of people is still clunky, despite the new mechanics. If you liked the first episode, you’ll love this one, despite the high school drama. If you did not play Judgment you can start with the new game to see how well it suits your tastes, since it can be enjoyed without knowing past events. All in all, it is a good sequel to a promising franchise.                            
80	                                With a story that tackles the subject of bullying with grit and realism, and gameplay improvements around the block, Lost Judgement surpasses its predecessor in almost every level. But the frustrating decision to lock the wonderfully written main side stories (school stories) behind an incessant amount of mini-games and backtracking is a black mark for the series that we sincerely hope we'll never ever see again.                            
80	                                The gameplay and the combat of Lost Judgment are phenomenal, the story is amazing, and the side missions are, as always, an absolute blast. Despite all of the positives, the world is a little bit too overcrowded and looks like something we've already seen before from RGG.                            
80	                                A weaker overall story and some serious pacing issues prevent Lost Judgment from reaching the excellence of its predecessor, but this is still a fantastic character-driven detective drama. Crunching combat and a frankly ridiculous amount of impressively in-depth side content make this one of the most robust Yakuza-style offerings ever — and that's more than enough to outweigh the game's often obvious flaws.                            
80	                                Lost Judgment is the legitimate sequel to Judgment, and does as well as its predecessor on most points. The faithful recreation of Tokyo and Yokohama is an invitation to exploration as the combat retains that franchise-specific intensity and technicality. As for the scenario, the latter literally takes the guts. The high school setting as well as the themes addressed perfectly compensate for the lack of a strong link with the Yakuza saga. Only certain gameplay mechanics that are too interventionist, and the noticeable absence of a new geographical area are to be deplored without this ruining the gaming experience.                            
80	                                Its detective elements may be lacking and its third act is slow, but it more than makes up for it, offering spectacle-heavy set pieces, an engrossing mystery, and a bounty of fantastic side missions. Whether a diehard fan of the Yakuza franchise or a newcomer looking to see what all the fuss is about, Lost Judgment is a thrilling adventure that shouldn't be missed.                            
80	                                Lost Judgment feels like the game Judgment was always meant to be, which is saying something given how well-received the original game was. With a bump in framerate and graphical capabilities, Ryu Ga Gotoku’s open-world stuns with its visuals and shocking story while delivering oodles of content for players to dig into. With its quality-of-life improvements and refined detective gameplay, It’s a no-brainer purchase if you enjoyed Judgment, but if you’re new to these games, it would also be a great place to start your Ryu Ga Gotoku journey.                            
80	                                Over the years, Sega has kept up a brisk pace with Yakuza and its spinoffs, releasing games that share a lot of the same DNA. However, despite the similarities between them, Lost Judgment still manages to stand out and make a strong case for itself by tightening up a lot of the weaker aspects of the first game. It introduces fun and addictive side activities like the school stories and seamlessly immerses you into its world. It may seem easy to write it off as just another Yakuza-type game at first glance, but once you start to walk the streets with Yagami, you’ll want to see this case through to the end.                            
80	                                Lost Judgment rectifies a lot of the shortcomings of its predecessor while repeating a few of them. A compelling murder mystery coupled with intoxicating side content and sumptuous visuals make this another solid Ryu ga Gotoku title even if franchise fatigue threatens to take off some of that shine. It succeeds by expanding on what made Judgment great while offering the best real-time combat experience yet. Plus, you can skateboard and solve crimes with a Shiba Inu – I don't think I need to say much more than that.                            
80	                                Lost Judgment is a sequel that builds on the strengths of the original installment. If Judgement was to your liking, then Lost judgment is a game you must buy.                            
80	                                Lively combat and engrossing social clubs keep you busy, but it’s the much-improved detective story that elevates Lost Judgment above the original.                            
80	                                This is still a Ryu Ga Gotoku production, meaning there’s an over-the-top and at times absurd line that weaves it way throughout the entire game. In short, Lost Judgment is a damn good time.                            
80	                                Judgment may have been an acquired taste in many ways, but the sequel makes some of the bitterness go down easier.                            
80	                                Takayuki Yagami is a great character and Lost Judgment is bigger and slightly better than the previous game, but still not enough to become a definitive classic series like Yakuza.                            
80	                                Lost Judgment is more of the same, with better detective work, great side cases, and fast-flowing combat.                            
80	                                Lost Judgment is a great follow up for the first title from Ryu ga Gotoku Studio, who takes everything that made the first game good and makes it better. Yagami and his friends will leave a lasting impression with this emotional story that shows the developer's strong writing and entertaining skills.                            
80	                                While Yagami’s second outing is more sprawling and silly than its predecessor, it’s also proof that bigger isn’t always better.                            
76	                                For a detective game, Lost Judgment presents an intriguingly complex story and a decent variety of gameplay and gadgets. However, it takes a long time to get interesting and the actual detective work is a bit too linear for hardcore mystery fans like me.                            
75	                                Throughout my time with Lost Judgement, I felt torn about how I ultimately felt about the game. There were moments that I really enjoyed, especially the combat, but the handling of sexual assault and some unimaginative mechanics left me frustrated at best. All in all, I would say Lost Judgement is a perfectly okay sequel that fans of the original Judgement are sure to enjoy. It may not be amazing, but that doesn’t mean it isn’t worth playing. If you can handle the negatives, some genuinely great moments in Lost Judgment are worth experiencing.                            
73	                                When Lost Judgment stumbles, it never recovers. While there's a lot to love in the story and gameplay, at the end of the day, its issues become too much to ignore – especially when those issues are messy and irresponsible.                            
70	                                As a whole, Lost Judgment is yet another strong outing for developer RGG Studio. Although this sequel is largely only a half step up compared to its predecessor, there's still so much to do in this world that can easily keep you entertained for hours on end. Even though I would have loved to see some more drastic improvements to many aspects of Lost Judgment, I still can't deny that I've had a great time in this second outing with Yagami, and I hope to see the series continue well into the future.                            
70	                                Lost Judgment is another great entry in the Yakuza franchise, but one shadowed by better entries. The combat is incredible, the world still exciting and full of character, and the story is a worthwhile telling - but please, please don't make me tail anyone anymore.                            
70	                                While Lost Judgment’s many systems might not look like much separately, together they succeed in creating a varied experience like no other. With the new setting of a Japanese high school and a story about bullying, the game depicts modern Japanese society in an exaggerated way similar to the Yakuza series while feeling fresh at the same time. However, shallow yet frequent battles and a story that starts to drag in the second half exhaust the player way more than necessary.                            
70	                                There’s so much reused content it barely feels like a new game at times but the storytelling in Lost Judgment is some of the best, and most thoughtful, the Yakuza series has ever known.                            
70	                                Lost Judgment improves on its predecessor by cutting down on some of the more tedious elements of its design rather than outright changing the mechanics to make the investigative side of the equation more engaging. In this sense, it's disappointing that it doesn't lean into what makes Judgment unique compared to the Yakuza series and instead remains at its best when sticking close to those origins. The story is compelling with an endearing cast of characters, the sheer amount of stuff to do is astounding, and there's still an inherent joy that comes from pummelling the city's delinquents into the ground. But it's hard not to feel disappointed that you still feel like a passenger when it breaks away from the Yakuza mould. If this is indeed our last time with Yagami and co., then it's one to cherish. There will just always be a nagging feeling that this was a missed opportunity to do something truly special.                            
70	                                Sega is clearly capable of making a compelling mystery game that could stand in league with the work we see out of studios like Naughty Dog, but that will require a more focused, better-paced approach that Lost Judgement seems eager to avoid.                            
70	                                Lost Judgment is a hell of a game, mess and all. Passing its predecessor in some regards and lagging behind in others, it at least has solid bang for your buck and brings the franchise goods that have been built upon over recent years. However, I'm disappointed by some of the shortfalls. Female character treatment remains a problem in-game and the mystery or detective gameplay don't feel as solid as the one prior. Still, if you're after a living breathing world with plenty to do and some of the best combat the series has seen yet, then this is a mystery adventure that still manages to hit hard.                            
70	                                Lost Judgment is a good follow-up to 2019's excellent Judgment. It's more of the same, but that doesn't matter too much when the core is already great.                            
60	                                Lost Judgment is a combination of a thriller movie with a smoothly playing and well-furnished action-adventure game, where you will easily need twenty to forty hours to reach the end. So much for the good news. The game suffers from the same disease as many Japanese genre rivals: it wants to cram too much into one game. A little more focus would do the series good.                            
60	                                Fans will love another outing with Tak and the gang. Despite improved combat, worse stealth and stripped back exploration can overshadow it. [Issue#7, p.88]                            
60	                                Lost Judgment is a mechanically sound Yakuza spin-off, but its convoluted story makes it feel like a TV show that's gone on a few seasons too long.                            
90	                                TOEM is a cute little game made by a Swedish studio that feels like a paper-made terrarium. From its unique art style to fun photography mechanics, user-friendly controls and a clear and lilting sound design, everything in TOEM works and feels polished. This is the kind of game that players may have a lot of fun with regardless of their skill or preferences. The ending of the game’s cozy journey is quite touching as well.                            
90	                                TOEM is a delightfully Zen experience, perfect for anyone looking to spend a few hours in some entertaining locales with a cute protagonist and a variety of photo quests that aren’t too taxing.                            
90	                                Toem is an enjoyable and charming game where you get to look at a beautifully hand-drawn world through multiple perspectives. There’s the right amount of challenge offered to keep players engaged in a chill experience that also tests their knack for capturing that perfect shot. This is a game to relax with, where the destination is as picture-perfect as the journey.                            
83	                                A casual speedrun to just get to the end will run about two hours, but if TOEM is played how it’s “intended,” then expect to get a few hours out of it, while completionists might hit five or more. If content’s your concern, there it is, but if a high-quality, easygoing experience to escape the anxiety of these pandemic times—or whatever ails you—then TOEM works wonders. The world needs more TOEM, and it’s been a pleasure to get to live in this meditative place, even if only for a short while.                            
80	                                I had a hard time putting TOEM down, its calming, cheerful nature feeling way too cozy to quit. Its photography-based puzzle gameplay will charm just about anyone that feels drawn to the title, so if you have even a remote interest in TOEM, it’s absolutely a safe bet. If you want 4 – 6 hours of wholesome fun that will leave you craving for more, take a little hike with TOEM.                            
80	                                It’s far from the typical hero’s journey. In this game you’re just a kid who listens to cassette tapes, and now has an old camera to document that adventure with. It reminded me of my summer trips to the Isle of Wight, making my own fun in ways only children can.                             
80	                                TOEM is like walking with a camera: relaxing and fun. Try it if you are in search of something diverse.                            
80	                                With its entertaining puzzles and wonderful soundtrack, TOEM is a super charming, short game that provides a relaxed yet still impactful experience.                            
75	                                Toem is a very pleasant and relaxing game. Ideal for playing with the family, this little photography game is smarter than it looks, thanks to a simple, but effective concept, well-made little puzzles and a universe without artifice, but cute as everything. Very short and accessible, the title of Something We Made is undoubtedly what you need if you want to indulge in a peaceful experience, populated by characters as absurd as they are amusing. It doesn't go any further than that, doesn't pretend to, and that is undoubtedly very good.                             
70	                                TOEM is a peaceful and funny journey through the eyes of a joyful photographer. With many surprises to discover and folks to help, TOEM is a (very) short but relaxing adventure, which controls could have deserved better care.                             
70	                                TOEM is a surprisingly well thought-out video game. With a camera and a diorama-like stage design, the adventure progresses slowly; you choose the pace and which tasks to complete. It is a contemplative title that seeks to manifest human good deeds and solidarity. Despite not taking advantage of the potential of its world to tell a good story and some far-fetched tasks, the result is more than remarkable. More than recommended.                             
100	                                Indeed, Tales of Arise is a game designed for long-term Tales franchise fans and those who have never picked up a franchise entry before, where story, combat, and various features come together to deliver a high-quality, highly-detailed JRPG. All of that makes it not just one of the best JRPGs on the market today, but one of the best games hands-down.                            
100	                                Tales of Arise is a games I would recommend for anyone looking for “the future” of the JRPG genre. This game could easily be Bandai Namco’s Final Fantasy 7. It feels tailor-made for the era and pushes the barriers for RPGs thanks to complex combat, weighty storytelling, and gorgeous visuals.                            
100	                                Tales of Arise is a revitalizing step in the right direction for the Tales of series, offering new players a chance to play Tales at its very best, and old fans an incredible journey that feels familiar. It’s hard not to love what Tales of Arise has to offer and while there are some small issues, it doesn’t take away from my opinion that this is the Tales game that will breathe new life into the series.                            
100	                                Tales of Arise offers a superb blend of JRPG favourites, tight combat, and modern-day design choices. It's easily the best Tales game in years.                            
100	                                Tales of Arise is a phenomenal game: an engrossing story, the best combat the Tales series has seen to date, and art direction that's nigh unmatched in its sheer beauty. But, impressive as those things are, what really sets this game apart—what really marks this as a bold new vision for the series—is how cleverly it twists JRPG conventions to unpack that well-worn "evil empire" trope. Tales of Arise is more than just a brilliant game; it's a nuanced, insightful thesis on the mechanisms of oppression and liberation.                            
100	                                Tales of Arise is magnificent. The writing is rich and evocative, and the developers took on a major creative challenge with the themes that they decided to tackle… and did a superb job. The combat system is sharp and offers plenty of complexity, while being accessible to Tales newcomers or people just looking to experience the story. The art and aesthetics are breathtaking, and about the only issue there is a lack of a photo mode so that I could make the most of it (what the hell, Bandai Namco?). I may not have been the world’s biggest fan of the Tales series previously, but this game has immediately become one of my favourite JRPGs of all time.                            
95	                                Tales of Arise is a huge leap forward for the series. Combat is incredibly fun and fluid, the story is fantastic despite a lackluster finale, and the characters are as charming as ever. It’s not only one of the best Tales games, but one of the best the PS5 has to offer.                            
93	                                Tales of Arise harmoniously balances beloved systems like visual novel-inspired skits and upgradable titles with new-and-improved gameplay tweaks. Intricate world-building in sub-quests and even mundane discussions help with pacing and narrative cohesion. Campy JRPG-centric themes like the power of friendship and slow-burn romantic tension are prevalent throughout. Nevertheless, I found myself completely invested in the tragedies and achievements the cast faced, even when awkward pauses and stiff cutscene animations threatened to break immersion. Tales of Arise is a fantastic reinvention of Bandai Namco’s tried and true formula. It might even be the best installment in the franchise to date.                            
93	                                Tales of Arise is exactly what I want in a Tales of game, but also a JRPG in general. It fulfills the promise of a modern-day Tales of title in a way no other game in the series has managed in over a decade. While Tales of Arise is clearly influenced by previous games in the series, it also takes cues from other long-running series like Xenoblade Chronicles and Star Ocean. However, Tales of Arise is its own beast—a refreshing, smartly designed, and just plain fun monument to its genre. I cannot recommend it highly enough.                            
92	                                Tales of Arise is a masterpiece with a deep story and endearing cast that will keep you hooked as you fight for freedom from tyrants. Meanwhile, the action-intense battles are great fun as you plan your moves to take down enemies as efficiently as possible. Exploring the dungeons and overworld is a joy, too, especially with new map abilities that make traversal engaging. It's the best Tales yet.                            
91	                                Tales Of Arise is a treat for fans of the franchise, but also an excellent jumping-on point for franchise newcomers.                            
90	                                Tales of Arise offers fast and fluid combat and an epic story, paving the way for the first great JRPG of a new console generation.                            
90	                                Tales of Arise could be the best title of the series, as it reinvigorates many of its great recipes that earned it a cult status. Great characters, amazing worlds and flashy combat are just a few of its greatest traits. But to experience them all, you have to play the game - which we strongly recommend you do.                            
90	                                Tales of Arise is a successfully comeback story. It’s definitely one of the most refreshing Tales game and probably one of the best JRPGs launched in 2021. I’m not sure if Bandai Namco planned to make the Tales franchise mainstream, but that’s something that Tales of Arise manage to achieve, and that’s probably the best compliment I can give the game. My only concern is related to how Bandai Namco chose to advertise the paid DLC in-game, which consists of cosmetic items and spice up your adventures through Dahna. Resting in camps will always run an advert in the right corner, which totally breaks immersion. Other than that, I believe Tales of Arise is not just the best game in the Tales series, but also one of the best titles launched this year. More importantly, the Tales franchise has finally gone mainstream and I’m very happy that more players are joining its fan club.                            
90	                                Tales of Arise is a fantastic RPG. With a big storyline that's much more complex than it looks, and touching characters, great design, combat playability, very nervous and close to a beat'em all, and very satisfying roleplaying aspects. And if the PS5 version doesn't have the most insane optimization, it's been a real pleasure to play this Tales of Arise. If J-RPG is your thing, you shouldn't miss it.                             
90	                                The Tales series celebrates its 25 years with a fantastic title that deserves to be played by all fans of the genre, in yet another demonstration of the good path that Bandai Namco has traced over the last few years, at least with PIs that don't come from known Anime and Manga. The intricate narrative accompanied by a relatable cast bursting with personality and an artistic direction so rich that paints the game's combat and setting elevates the series and makes Tales of Arise one of the best JRPGs of 2021.                            
90	                                With an excellent story and cast and a reinvigorated combat system, Tales of Arise is the shot in the arm the long-running Tales RPG series needed to recapture its best moments.                            
90	                                Tales of Arise heralds a brilliant new dawn for the series and is one of the best RPGs of the last generation.                            
90	                                Tales of Arise includes the trademarks of the franchise and shows that twenty-five years of experience help to strive for perfection. Just like a good wine, the franchise has managed to get better with age. The battle system, anime-inspired visuals, and a story full of lovely characters are the stars of the show, which ultimately make a game that shouldn’t be overlooked. Tales of Arise is an entry that will satisfy die-hard fans and convert newcomers to the series with its awesome experience.                            
90	                                Tales of Arise is the peak of Tales of franchise, where the dev team managed to use years of experience to craft something really great.                            
90	                                Tales of Arise has all the familiar features that we know and (mostly) love from the “Tales of” series (i.e. combat system, skits, great characters etc.), but at the same time it surpasses most of its predecessors by excelling visually, aesthetically and in its world building.                            
90	                                Tales of Arise is a high-quality JRPG and the next technical leap in a series that continues to take steps in the right direction on the occasion of its 25th anniversary. The playable renewal that it proposes places it as one of the most powerful titles of the year and as an excellent entry for players looking to get started in the franchise.                            
90	                                Tales of Arise is the best option for this year regarding the JRPG genre. It is a game that you will fall in love with through its storytelling and a set of characters for whom you can actually feel something. Tt also features an acceptable progression system as well as fun battles, some interesting main missions (not so much for the secondary stuff), optional events, impactful visuals... it has everything.                            
90	                                Tales of Arise is an excellent introduction to the series for new players and a fantastic entry for old fans. If this is any indication, the franchise is in for a bright future. Hopefully, it won’t be another five years before the next one.                            
90	                                Tales of Arise is gorgeous. The lands are lush and vibrant, even those trapped in extreme weather patterns. Calaglia’s arid landscape makes me thirsty and trudging through Cyslodia’s tundra reminds me of long Canadian winters. Sadly this all seems to be lost when it’s time to throw in some anime. The switch from game graphics to anime cutscenes is actually rather jarring and I’m not a fan. I like the anime separately as its own entity, just not within the game itself. If the coloring matched the game, sure. But it washes out all of the hard work the level design team put into the game. Pair this with just way too much going on with the artes system and you can see how, though a fantastic game, it falls just shy of hitting a perfect ten.                            
90	                                Tales of Arise went above and beyond our expectations. With its picturesque landscapes instilling a real sense of adventure, it's easily one of the strongest, most cohesive Tales games to date. Dramatic cutscenes and memorable character moments help sell an intriguing story, while a satisfying combat system becomes more and more engaging as your party powers up. A fantastic, modernised journey with all the rewarding qualities of a classic JRPG.                            
90	                                With Tales of Arise, I think the Tales series is finally ready to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the heavy hitters of the JRPG genre – Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest. This is a masterfully crafted adventure, and the best JRPG I've played in a very long time. Combining stunning visuals with a gripping story and the most exciting combat system found in a JRPG yet, this is a must-have for fans of the genre. Its standalone story makes this a great entry point for those looking to get into the Tales series, too. Put simply, Tales of Arise is outstanding.                            
90	                                Tales of Arise brings some needed fresh air to its beloved Action JRPG franchise while sticking faithfully to its classic formula. The renewed visuals and the more mature art-style should not alienate the fandom: at its core, this game is a very classic Tales of title, with new additions that make it an even more memorable experience.                            
90	                                Tales of Arise is the grand adventure we've been waiting for, and more, for veteran players and new fans alike. Its addictive and satisfying combat design, breathtaking narrative, gorgeous presentation, and engaging cast make it the quintessential JRPG to play. The characters met in this entry add to the growing cast of memorable personalities this series has given us, solidifying it as a true Tales title.                            
90	                                Tales of Arise accomplishes the rare feat of catering to its many fans while simultaneously making a compelling case for newcomers to give it a try, and it's a JRPG must-play that was more than worth the wait.                             
90	                                Tales of Arise is an excellent JRPG that delivers just about everything you want from the genre: a rich story, intriguing characters, satisfying combat, and an endless amount of lore. The game isn’t able to skirt around the issues that often plague JRPGs, which I feel will make for a higher barrier of entry for newcomers. That said, Fans of the series and those that just love a good JRPG will fall in love with what’s there in Tales of Arise.                            
90	                                If this is anything to go off, the series has years left in it yet. This title makes it clear that the folks at Bandai Namco have it in them to move with the times, without losing the essence of what a Tales game is.                            
90	                                Tales of Arise reinvigorates the magic of the long-running series. A franchise that long rested on its established laurels has been refreshingly upgraded and reinvented, resulting in one of the most polished and jaw-dropping JRPGs I've played in a long time. It's an exciting new chapter for the Tales series that won't be soon forgotten.                            
90	                                With its engaging story, dark atmosphere, charming characters, and excellent combat, Tales of Arise provides an experience that feels both new and familiar at the same time, making for a game that both long-time fans and newcomers will enjoy.  While the excessive linearity and the removal of multiplayer will disappoint some, the pros far outweigh the cons, making Tales of Arise one of the best entries in the series to date.                            
90	                                Combining the best ideas of the past three generations of 3D action JRPGs, stripped of excess and micromanagement, Tales of Arise is one of the most tactile and frenetic action-narrative experiences to come out of Japan in recent memory.                            
90	                                For those who thirst for the epic JRPGS of old, Tales of Arise manages to live up to lofty expectations and then some.                            
87	                                Surprising twists and turns, a more serious story and the picturesque graphics entice Tales of Arise with many hours of JRPG fun in a slightly lifeless and linear world.                            
87	                                Tales of Arise was a fresh but familiar experience. The game iterated on the series formula enough to keep progressing the series while maintaining the Tales charm. The combat system is as fluid as ever, and I found it to be engaging and fun. The area that the game shines the most is in its characters, both during the course of the main story or the skits that break up the action. Overall, Tales of Arise is a great example of a classic series that keeps improving while maintaining its identity.                            
86	                                Tales of Arise is a great game and a significant step forward from its predecessor, a wonderful mix of bright narrative and excellent gameplay.                            
85	                                Deluxe-RPG with a magnificent universe and a prime storyline, which however only unfolds late. Bland side quests tarnish the overall picture.                            
85	                                It’s been a while, but Tales of Arise is finally here. And you know what? It was worth the wait. This is one hell of an RPG, with an epic story drenched in adventure and atmosphere. The combat is accessible, yet deep and challenging, and the journey takes you to some truly remarkable places. Shame the sidecontent isn’t always quite as interesting.                            
85	                                Tales of Arise doesn't do anything new, but also almost nothing wrong. The story continues to captivate from start to finish, although some of the plot twists are quite predictable for the seasoned JRPG player. The combat is the showpiece of the game and offers wonderful depth, challenges your tactical ability and is a feast for the eyes. You take the small flaws for granted and quickly forget as you wander through the beautiful settings of Dahna and beyond.                             
85	                                With a fun and intuitive combat system, some clever characterization and a gorgeous oil painting look, Tales of Arise is a must have JRPG which shows a confident step in the right direction for the series as a whole.                            
85	                                When I think back on Tales of Arise, the combat will definitely come to mind. The big boss battles that blew me away, and the wonderful feeling of free-forming a combo into a Mystic Arte and then closing the battle off with a Boost Strike. The story was ultimately good, and the world was gorgeous. But really, it’s going to be the campfire moments. It’s going to be how Alphen, Shionne, Rinwell, Law, Kisara, and Dohalim came together as a party, grew closer, fought and struggled together, and saw it all through to the end, one hastily thrown-together outdoor meal at a time. Tales of Arise nails that, and so it feels like a strong step forward for a series with a bright future ahead of it.                            
85	                                Tales of Arise brilliantly succeeds in breathing new life into the Tales Of saga. With its universe and its successful characters, the title delivers a striking adventure that takes advantage of superb environments thanks to a unique graphic rendering. The fights are not left out either since they show great intensity with always more spectacle, sometimes even if it means confusing the action. If we can blame it for his clipping, its talkative side, or its redundant bestiary, we still salute its many qualities which suggest good for the future of the series.                             
85	                                After previous attempts only achieved half-measures, Tales of Arise finally takes the series in a new direction. There are sure to be veterans who lament some of the changes in the name of expanding the audience, but the risks taken here pay off nicely. The visuals are a marked improvement from any previous entry, and the combat looks and feels better than ever, even if it comes at the cost of losing some depth. Arise’s narrative admirably tackles some ambitious themes, though not all beats hit their mark. However, despite a few flaws, Tales of Arise is a fantastic RPG that stands as one of the best the series has to offer.                            
85	                                Tales of Arise delivers a fresh start with new heroes and a world that feels all too familiar. The story of an oppressed people living in a land divided into five parts, that need to be liberated isn't quite original, but Arise does offer a streamlined experience that can be highly tailored. Those that want to, can delve into the lore, while others can happily skip that entirely. The same applies to combat, which can be tailored to the player's desire, from (semi)automatic to manual and challenging.                            
85	                                Bandai Namco created something special here. Fast-paced, accessible combat meets a well-constructed narrative told with beautiful visuals, wonderful voice work, and an impeccable soundtrack. Even with its odd issue here and there, nothing stands in the way of Tales of Arise succeeding on all levels.                            
85	                                Tales of Arise presents the first step in the evolution of the series and a chance for newcomers to get familiar with the franchise.                            
84	                                Tales of Arise is a fantastic entry in the long-running franchise, with a beautiful crafted world, unforgettable characters and a wonderful soundtrack. However, it also boasts a lot of technical problems that can't simply be ignored.                             
84	                                This is a fantastic JRPG that builds upon its great art style and its spectacular battles.                            
83	                                Overall Tales of Arise has a great premise and story, and is one of the better Tales games Bandai Namco has produced. If you are a JRPG fan, or a Tales fan give this game a good look.                            
83	                                Tales of Arise is the best game in the series, with a brilliant combat system and a story with a lot of important themes tied to the atrocious consequences of post-colonialism.                            
80	                                Some JRPG-typical dramatics and muddled combat aside, Arise is a feast for any JRPG fan – beautiful, intuitive and earnest. The best in the series to date. [Issue#7, p.86]                            
80	                                One of the most memorable JRPGs in recent years. [Issue#364, p.114]                            
80	                                A very good action JRPG. Very traditional, very spectacular, well done, a feast for eyes and ears, fun and addictive. It’s not, however, innovative in any way.                            
80	                                For an adventure game, the graphics and story are pretty interesting, but for an JRPG, the game is lacking in a lot of elements. While it has RPG trappings, it feels far more like an adventure/action game, which is a knock against those looking for some JRPG action. The graphics, story, characters and overall package are very well done. However it is hard to shake the feeling of the game being far more style over substance, which in general JRPG-ers are not looking for.                            
80	                                Bandai Namco promised that “now is the time for change,” and Tales of Arise legitimately feels like a game that’s trying to bring change to Japanese RPGs. It’s strong characters, epic story, engrossing battle system, and lush visuals are only marred by a disappointing final act, and those areas of the game where the team refused to let go of outdated ideas and conventions. If the Tales team can find it in themselves to push things just a little further, then this might truly be the spark that sets off a revolution in a genre that’s needed a regime change for so long now.                            
80	                                With a beautiful new style, a more adult narrative, wonderful characters, and a modernised tone and feel, Tales of Arise brings the franchise smashing into the current era. It’s still got the tried-and-true Tales flavour, both good and bad, yet innovates with fluid combat that feels fresh. The best and most essential Tales game in well over a decade.                            
80	                                Tales of Arise has a chaotic, but manageable and strategic combat system, a vibrant and beautifully crafted world for you to explore and characters you can see yourself in. The main thread of the story - an underdog bringing an end to tyranny - is a great set-up.                            
80	                                A great experience and brand new breath for the saga. Tales of Arise doesn't quite shake itself from bad old habits in the second part of the game, but it won't spoil its charm and the very interesting story.                            
80	                                Tales of Arise is a triumph in almost every way, delivering a strong narrative, well-developed characters, and combat that feels snappier than ever. This is the next step in the evolution of the Tales series, and the future looks awfully bright.                            
80	                                This feels like a safe yet enjoyable follow-up to Berseria. Longtime fans will be satisfied with this entry after the five-year wait since the last mainline game even though Tales of Arise doesn’t feel like it strays too far away from the standard series formula.                            
80	                                Tales of Arise is a beautiful JRPG that is fun to play that fans of the genre will no doubt get a lot out of. Its gradual introduction of mechanics also makes it a wonderful experience for those looking to dip their toes into JRPGs for the first time or after a long time away from them.                            
80	                                Tales of Arise is a well-made, consistently enjoyable JRPG, and though its storytelling tends to be inconsistent, its gorgeous world and consistently enjoyable combat are more than enough to keep you hooked until the end.                            
80	                                Tales of Arise comes to prove that the series still has a lot to say. At a time when fans of the genre are in for a treat, Bandai Namco has decided to join the party and offer us one of the best instalments of the franchise. A perfect entry into the franchise, with an interesting story, charismatic characters, beautiful artwork and a combat system that's as accessible as it is deep. It takes a while to get going, but when it does, it's hard to put the controller down before starting the next dungeon.                            
80	                                I came away from Tales of Arise with a new appreciation for the Tales series. I loved my time with the endearing cast of characters and the exciting, fast-paced story alongside the energetic and action-packed battles. Tales of Arise is an excellent action RPG, and a fantastic entry point into the series.                            
80	                                Tales of Arise is a thrilling JRPG to play. While the story takes a bit of time to get going, a complex combat system and some neat time-saving options mean you'll always come back for more.                            
80	                                Tales of Arise is able to please both longtime fans of the saga and newbies: accessible, aesthetically satisfying and always with a smooth pace, it has managed to refresh the combat system with an excellent compromise between action and strategy , without however setting aside the parametric component:  an adventure that absolutely deserves to be lived.                            
80	                                Tales of Arise is the best Tales game in over a decade. It’s the advancement the series has needed for quite some time now, such as the far more explorative dungeon designs (as small as they are) and the switch to the Unreal Engine. On top of that, the majority of the cast of characters are compelling enough to keep your attention locked on the story, and the combat reinvigorates the tried and true formula into something special.                            
80	                                Arise is a good episode, which could have been excellent if it didn't get its feet wet in its last third. At the moment of concluding and confirming all the nice things put forward during the journey, the series falls back into its old ways with unbearable corridors, full of color swap enemies on 10 hours of gameplay that leave a bitter taste. It's a pity, especially since the combat system and the world building are the most solid we've seen on a Tales Of in quite some time.                            
80	                                While Tales of Arise isn't perfect by any means, it is a meaty, colourful, and engaging game that I think should be on any self-respecting JRPG fans must-play list. Mastering the action combat is a thrilling and rewarding experience, as is the satisfaction of finding rare materials to craft with or taking down massive beasts for big rewards. The overarching plot is richly detailed, filled with twists and turns that will keep you interested, all while embarking on the journey with a party of well-realised characters. With some minor flaws found in the game's competing visual styles, graphical options, and side quest content, I think there are more than enough positives to be found that Tales of Arise could easily end up being one of the best RPGs released this year.                            
80	                                Tales of Arise is a fun game, but one with a bit of tonal disparity to it. One moment, you'll be searching for owls wearing goofy accessories on behalf of the owl king, and then next you'll watch in horror as a town of people is literally liquified before your eyes. As long as you try not to think too much about the stifling and nearly overwhelming amount of horror the characters have been put through, you'll likely feel like you got your money's worth of this very long and winding game.                            
70	                                Taken as a whole, Tales of Arise is a very good RPG, boasting beautiful visuals, a wonderful cast of characters, and engaging combat mechanics--but its flaws (and that odious DLC) are also difficult to ignore. If you're looking for a lengthy, charming, and engaging JRPG to play on your shiny new console or PC gaming rig, Tales of Arise is certainly a fine choice. Just don't go into it expecting an all-time classic.                            
100	                                Forza Horizon 5 looks phenomenal, plays well and is practically flawless. It is undoubtedly the best entry in the series and has the most detailed open world in any game to date.                            
100	                                I absolutely adore Forza Horizon 5, and while it’s possible to fault it as being a bit more of the same when compared to Forza Horizon 4, I’m not sure that’s actually a bad thing. It’s a more polished experience overall, and while it may be playing it safe just a tad, it’s hard to deny that the game is a technical marvel, and a fantastic show piece for Xbox Series X and 4K displays everywhere. Even if you opt to play in performance mode to hit that sweet 60fps spot, you’ll be pleasantly surprised with how great everything looks in motion. So yes, if you’re not already convinced, do yourself a favor and check out Forza Horizon 5 when it launches this week.                            
100	                                Let’s be clear for a moment: Forza Horizon has always been good. From the moment it burst onto the scene in 2012 as a spin-off to the core, more po-faced Forza Motorsport series, it established itself as a fun, thrilling, and subversively moreish alternative thread for racing on Xbox. It was in many ways the spiritual, open-world successor to Project Gotham Racing, and in turn traced its roots back to arcade racing royalty like OutRun. This is a tough lineage to stand up to, but Horizon 5 takes all that history and experience and runs with it, incrementally upgrading this series into must-play brilliance. It’s an achievement of a game.                            
100	                                The people over at Playground Games proved -yet again- that they are capable of delivering the very best arcade racing experience. Forza Horizon 5 is truly a superb game in a league of its own.                            
100	                                It’s always a difficult task to raise the bar on something that’s already top notch, and when it comes to the racing games, due to the natural limits of the genre, the task gets even harder. But thanks to the now more mature than ever PlayGround studio, Forza Horizon 5 crushes its own bar and reaches a whole new level, easily becoming one of the best and most complete racing games of all time, if not THE best.                            
100	                                In conclusion, play Forza Horizon 5. There has never been a better looking game, and it plays like an absolute dream. It’s full of cars, full of challenge, full of glorious visuals and played out across a world like no other.                            
100	                                Forza Horizon 5 somehow raised an insurmountable bar to new heights. Playground Games continued to show off their prowess with game development and their striving to make a game that is fun for every type of player in every aspect of gameplay. Regardless of if you’re a racing fan or not, if you have Game Pass, Forza Horizon 5 needs to be the next game you play. You never know, it could be the jumping-off point into a new genre that you never knew you’d click with.                            
100	                                I went into Forza Horizon 5 expecting a pretty racing game. What I got was an experience, a splendid open-world car exploration simulator with light RPG elements and a trunk full of things to do and see. While I’d like to see Playground try something new or perhaps break free from the existing formula next time, this is a clear candidate for 2021’s best game and a must-play, whether you have Game Pass or not.                             
100	                                Forza Horizon 5 features all the content from the previous game and bumps the fun of this Horizon title. The game looks stunning and the gameplay is the same casual fun of Forza Horizon. The replayability of this game makes it outstanding and deserving of a perfect score.                            
100	                                Forza Horizon 5 is indeed the FAST & FURIOUSLY good and if you’re looking for a true next-gen racer, it’s finally arrived! And like Dom Toretto, Forza Horizon 5 lets you live your virtual life at a quarter mile at a time.                            
100	                                Forza Horizon 5 accomplishes that which so many franchises try again, and again, but fail to do so: get better with each and every entry. Playground Games and Turn 10 Studio's magnificent display brings about one of the best racing games of all time to Microsoft. Is this 2021's GOTY?                             
100	                                Overall, this is a Forza Horizon game in every sense of the word, and shows off the best of what Horizon can be. It’s fun, only structured if you want it to be, and seems to exist purely to make sure you have a good time. What more could you want?                            
100	                                Forza Horizon 5 is a true masterpiece. The new Mexican setting brings in wonderful landscapes, alongside a majestic implementation of the whole graphic compartment. And the contents offered are no less, with a mountain of modes suitable for both those who prefer the single player experience and those who love co-op or competitive ones. A sumptuous work and a true statement of love to the racing games genre in general.

100	                                Forza Horizon 5 is the culmination of all of Playground Games' efforts to perfect its craft, and the result is the best open-world racing game you can play. It combines the most beloved parts of Forza Horizon 3 and 4 into one ultimate racer.                            
100	                                Forza Horizon 5 sets a new industry gold standard for racing game visuals, gameplay, and map design. Our expectations of map design just leveled up with Horizon 5, and it’s another massive victory for Game Pass members who will get it on release day. The good news for players is that there’s future DLC content to come, which will only add to what is comfortably the most exciting next-gen racing game released so far.                            
100	                                Collectively, Forza Horizon 5 does everything right, and in doing so makes Playground Games’ latest entry into the Forza franchise an absolute must-play for any racing enthusiast or casual racing fan.                             
100	                                Forza Horizon 5 is a stunning and beautifully crafted entry in the series that's full of memorable races, creativity, and fantastic additions.                            
100	                                Forza Horizon 5 is a deep and nuanced car nirvana for revheads and auto geeks to endlessly collect, tinker, and experiment. It’s also an extremely accessible buffet of racing spectacle open to everyone, from Deluxe Edition diehards to Game Pass nomads – no matter their driving skill or mechanical knowledge. It’s an occasionally goofy but always earnest Valentine to Mexico’s world-famous culture, and a romantic ode to the magic of road-tripping through postcard-perfect vacation vistas. It’s a long haul, MMO-inspired racer that’s exploding with more races, activities, and event types than can comfortably fit on some parts of the map – and yet it still always feels relaxed rather than daunting. It never locks you into something you don’t want to do and steadily rewards you for however you choose to play it. It looks beautiful, it sounds magnificent, and it is glorious to play. Yes, Forza Horizon 5 is a lot of things. Above all, however, it is the result of a racing studio at the peak of its craft and the best open-world racing game I’ve ever played.                            
100	                                Beautiful, vast, creative, varied, and exciting, Forza Horizon 5 is an incredible game that will have you hooning around Mexico for months. There's an amazing sense of variety to everything about this game, and the smart Accolades system should have many achievement hunters hooked as they explore the full extent of what this remarkable racer has to offer. Fantastic handling, interesting events, and a wonderful history-spanning selection of cars makes for an amazing experience — arguably the best game in the series to date, and inarguably the best game in the series to DOOT. See you in Mexico, amigos...                            
100	                                Forza Horizon 5 proves that even the best games can get better. An unparalleled driving experience that also happens to be a graphical showcase like no other.                             
100	                                Forza Horizon 5 is the best game in the series and the best Xbox Series X/S game to date. Its flawless racing and wealth of activities are backed up by a gorgeous setting and a fantastic new progression system which encourages players to focus on the features they enjoy most. Utterly essential.                            
100	                                Forza Horizon 5 is a visual spectacle and a masterpiece, providing plenty to do and tons of fun to be had around every corner.                            
99	                                Forza Horizon 5 is a must buy game for racing fans and casual gamers alike. I don’t know how, but Playground Games has made gains over Horizon 4 that I really didn’t think would be possible. The visuals are stunning, the sound is amazing, the number of things to do is almost overwhelming and the gameplay feels refined, making it an amazing open world racing game experience. The freedom to go pretty much anywhere in the Mexican will eat up a lot of time. Sure, there have been network issues, but these seem to be disappearing, allowing for an almost flawless experience. So, why are you still reading, go play this game on Game Pass, or flip a few extra dollars for the deluxe version and you get the VIP ranking, access to two expansions and a few extra cars that you might most likely enjoy.                            
98	                                Forza Horizon 5 takes an already-amazing series and makes it better with a grander scale, but also an increase in quality. Even in its earliest days, it’s clear that the game will have a longer shelf life than prior entries thanks to the revamping of user-generated content adding more kinds of gameplay to the mix. Having things like obstacle courses thrown in helps evoke a bit of Project Gotham Racing, while the increase in NPCs and overall world-building makes for a better overall experience. Forza Horizon 5 is a more back-to-basics game in the sense that it puts the player on an ascendable ladder and doesn’t feel aimless like the prior two games – which in hindsight, were a bit unwieldy with regards to giving the player a set path to actually enjoy its many offerings. Forza Horizon 5 is the best entry in the series yet and should only get better as time goes on and more content is added.                            
98	                                Forza Horizon 5 is the leap to the new generation of Xbox. Playground Games has been able to improve an almost unbeatable experience, with an exquisite localization and gameplay, which manages to offer a level of immersion rarely seen before in the open world driving genre.                             
97	                                Forza Horizon 5 is the best open world driving game ever and one of the best in the speed genre globally. Playground Games has once again surpassed itself with a varied ‘crossover’ in which each kilometer traveled is worth its weight in fun and spectacularity.                             
96	                                It's unbelievable, but Playground games has surpassed the already brilliant Forza Horizon 4 in every way and sets a new standard for the fun you can have in a racing game. Forza Horizon 5 is a must-have, even as a racing novice, and the perfect excuse to get an Xbox Series X. Viva la Mexico!                             
95	                                Forza Horizon 5 [is] the first killer, can’t-miss game for the current generation Xbox Series X and S consoles as well as Microsoft’s Game Pass subscription service. It’s a game that I think anyone can immediately find appealing.                            
95	                                Forza Horizon 5 is the best Forza yet and, not only that, but it also makes a strong case for being the best racing game period. A joyous combo of arcade racing and simulation-level depth, all wrapped up in a beautiful bow thanks to its diverse, expansive Mexico setting, this is an unmissable iteration in what is arguably gaming’s most consistently fantastic series.                            
95	                                Forza Horizon 5 is the pinnacle of the Playground Games series and is the new king of open world courses. To oust such a noble predecessor was not easy but the Leamington boys have further embellished the playful recipe and made the progression in Horizon Adventure clearer. In addition to the splendid expeditions around Mexico, the arrival of 360-degree editors such as Event Lab will allow the community to create wonders and expand a basic offer with few equals, both in terms of quantity and quality. Hypercars of all brands are even more enjoyable to drive and the audiovisual presentation goes to great lengths to strive for the full next-gen. While waiting to know what the future holds for us as a flagship team of the Xbox family, we can finally enjoy this monumental experience.                             
95	                                Forza Horizon 5 turns "more of the same" into a mark of true excellence, furtherly polishing and improving on a winning formula and making it exponentially more spectacular on a technical level and more enveloping on an environmental level, and mixing it all with its distinctive driving model, a unique mix of a simulative superstructure with an arcade heart beating beneath the hood.                            
95	                                ¡Ay, caramba! Forza Horizon 5 is maturing under the Mexican sun a recipe concocted by Playground Games that has already delighted millions of pilots. Like an antojito, Forza Horizon 5 can be enjoyed in a good mood with anyone, anytime. Rolling over everything that has already been technically done and taking advantage of the Xbox Series X springboard to stamp the skies, Microsoft's software climbs the volcano of fun and unleashes an exhilarating torrent to be experienced alone or with others. It’s the festival of the decade.                             
95	                                At every turn, Forza Horizon 5 impresses in ways few games have. From the first mile, I was on the edge of my seat. With so much to do in such a relentlessly gorgeous world, I suspect it won’t be long before I get the itch to jump back into the driver’s seat of my favorite car. Even amidst a competitive racing field, Forza Horizon 5 is a finely tuned supercar.                            
95	                                We can't turn a blind eye to the sporadically unfair AI, but that is also the only genuinely bad thing we have to say about Forza Horizon 5, a phenomenal racing game that excels on almost every front which makes this one of the best race games to date. This is a must have: a love letter to racing and pure, unadulterated fun.                            
95	                                If you're looking for an arcade racing game with an enormous amount of races, an awesome multiplayer, a lot of things to find and collect, and amazing graphics, you have finally found it!                            
95	                                Though it’s iterative in a lot of ways, Forza Horizon 5 is a near-faultless open-world racing experience that’s so sure of itself and its offerings that it goes the extra mile to sprinkle in the kinds of fan service that people go wild for. As a game it’s tremendous, but it’s also a brilliant, interactive postcard for a culture that is passionate about few things more than their country and their cars.                            
95	                                Its stunning visuals, huge content and fun multiplayer ideas prove that Forza Horizon 5 is the most enjoyable racing game of all time.                            
93	                                Forza Horizon 5 is the "best of" all the series entries. Playground Games found the key to present the ginormous amount of content in a smooth way in one of the best open worlds ever made. Mexico is a magical, fascinating and adventurous place to drive in, and the glorious graphics of the game give us the real next gen experience we were looking for.                            
93	                                Following to the letter its own formula in terms of gameplay, controls, structure and open world design, Forza Horizon 5 becomes the new pinnacle of the franchise due to the special way that it transports us to the beautiful Mexican landscapes, taking harnessing all the power of the Xbox Series X to become one of the first games of this new generation that undoubtedly feels like a new generation. Some rough edges at the level and interface and progression slow it down from true perfection, but its virtues overshadow those flaws and of course, make it one of the best games of this 2021.                             
92	                                Forza Horizon 5, the latest masterpiece of the Playground team, manages to be a flawless production in almost every sense.                            
92	                                Quotation forthcoming.                            
92	                                Forza Horizon 5 is an incredible step forward for the series: with a plethora of brand new missions and challenges, and brilliant ideas to represent a colourful nation through eleven diverse biomes, Playground Games reaches new heights and shows the real face of the new generation of consoles.                            
92	                                That’s the thing about Forza Horizon 5 - it’s like a Forza Horizon greatest hits album. The handling and fundamental mechanics remain unrivalled; the cars are still absolutely stunning; and as for Mexico as an environment… well, it’s honestly a bit mind-blowing – especially on new-gen consoles (although it works perfectly on the lower-end Xbox One S console, too). Ultimately, it’s hard to fault Forza Horizon 5 at all. Sure, it may not be brimming with exciting innovations, but it’s packed to the rafters with the entire franchise's most memorable, compelling content, informed by everything that Playground Games has learned over the last nine years. Forza Horizon is most definitely a jewel in Xbox's crown, and Forza Horizon 5 is quite possibly the shiniest of them all.                            
91	                                At its core, Forza Horizon 5 is about having fun behind the wheel. It’s technically excellent and plays brilliantly, but it never takes itself too seriously. I mean, I jumped a pinata float off a mountain at one point. That balance makes the Horizon series the most grin-inducing racing games out there, and arguably one of the largest feathers in Xbox Game Studios’ cap.                            
90	                                After four previous tours, there’s certainly a feeling of familiarity that can lessen its impact at times, and hopefully the online issues will stabilize soon. Forza Horizon 5 is less of a leap forward than its predecessor, for sure, but that doesn’t stop it from delivering an impeccably crafted world with a staggering number of fantastic things to do and jaw-dropping places to see. As much as it’s a racing game, it’s also a driving adventure. It balances chaos and precision, exploration and speed, and it gets our wholehearted recommendation for anyone who wants to get behind the wheel.                            
90	                                Forza Horizon 5 offers more of everything we loved with part four. The competitions are crazier and the exploration more dynamic than ever before. Some elements do seem to go on repeat, but still manage to feel fresh thanks to the environmental change. An adrenaline-filled experience no one should miss, quite simply.                             
90	                                Despite a few minor quibbles, Forza Horizon 5 is a triumph for its series, taking everything the last several titles set up so well and making a bigger and better game than its predecessors. Any fan of racing games needs to check it out now, and even if you’re not usually into the genre, you may surprise yourself with how well it pulls you in. Forza Horizon 5 is a taste of gaming nirvana that is not to be missed.                            
90	                                After 5 games with build-up, we are left with a staggeringly good game that delivers both quality and entertainment beyond all expectations. It is both big, beautiful, varied and very, very fun.                             
90	                                Quotation forthcoming.                            
90	                                Overall, I’m extremely happy with how Forza Horizon 5 has turned out. The variety in activities as well as care and attention put into its mechanics and world makes Mexico such a delight to explore. It’s most certainly the best game in the series, and could well be the best game on Xbox right now.                            
90	                                There’s a sense of unfettered joy in everything here. It’s a game that just wants to be fun. For everyone. It aims for every moment you spend with it — be it five minutes or five hours — to be a frustration-free, jaw-dropping, reward-filled delight. And in this endeavour it succeeds marvellously. If there was ever a racing game that needs to be in every Xbox owner’s library, Forza Horizon 5 is it.                            
90	                                You absolutely can't go wrong with what is easily one of the most impressive open-worlds in gaming. Whether you plan on staying for a week, or hanging on for dear life for years to come, Forza Horizon 5 has more than enough to keep you busy and smiling across jungles, deserts and active volcanos.                            
90	                                The best in the series so far, that embraces the open world approach in a way previous entries never quite did – while also being an endlessly enjoyable and highly varied arcade racer.                            
90	                                Forza Horizon 5 is a monument to freedom, adrenaline and arcade fun, in a Mexico whose dimension is rivaled by its breath-taking beauty. With hundreds of cars, dozens of events and an immaculate driving experience, it's by far the best arcade racing game of the year, with a surprising depth that might even surprise the sim racing purists.                            
90	                                Forza Horizon 5 once again demonstrates Playground's mastery with an Xbox and PC exclusive that sets a new technological standard in the genre.                            
90	                                With Forza Horizon 5, Playground doesn't shake up its arcade racing formula, but when it works so well, why change? Especially since Mexico in this episode offers undoubtedly the best map of the series, with an amazing variety of biomes and an attention to detail that borders on respect, especially on such a massive playing surface. FH5 is a title that manages to do everything it does with its hands in its pockets. Its also one of the most beautiful games of the  current generation.                            
90	                                The new Forza Horizon is here, but the word "new" must be handled with care. For the most part, the fifth part is the same as the fourth. The content has just swelled in all aspects, the career has deepened its storytelling and fans of multiplayer and shared experiences have even more options to get rid of it. This is the fullest part ever with the potential to entertain you for years to come, and since the four are among the best racing games of all time, its slight evolution can't be any different.                            
90	                                Forza Horizon 5 absolutely lives up to the pedigree established by its predecessors. By using almost everything that worked in FH4, the game would've been a strong contender even if all it did was change its locale. The few changes in FH5 work heavily in its favor and contribute positively to the idea that the game is difficult to put down because it's fun and there's so much to do. For those who have played previous entries in the series, jump on this one immediately. For series newcomers, FH5 is a perfect place to start.                            
90	                                Forza Horizon 5 is a solid bet from the beginning and a visual delight for Xbox Series X.                            
90	                                Forza Horizon 5 is flashy and vibrant. It packs in pretty much everything one could want out of a racing game, with a broad selection of cars, tracks, and challenges to complete. Its addition to Xbox Game Pass alone should be reason enough to try it, but it stands as one of the best Xbox exclusives out right now regardless. It might not do much to separate itself from the other entries mechanically, but Forza Horizon 5 is the best the series has felt yet.                            
90	                                Forza Horizon 5 is probably the best arcade racing game of recent times, and one of the most prominent releases from this year. Even if cars is not your thing, there is plenty to love in this new Microsoft exclusive.                            
90	                                Forza Horizon 5 is ultimately a game in the franchise that continues to evolve in a more and more enjoyable direction, even if there is a core to the game that feels very familiar.                            
90	                                Forza Horizon 5 is so stacked it’s hard not to feel a little overwhelmed with options. But there’s never really a sense that you need to do any of it, or progress through a series of checklists before moving on to the next thing. And in the end this might be the genius at the heart of Horizon, you’ll want to keep moving, keep driving, simply because you want to. Because it feels right. And in creating a vast, beautiful open-world in which you can do that very thing, Playground Games lives up to its namesake.                            
90	                                There is a lot in here that will keep you busy for days and weeks on end, in the best way possible. This game builds on everything that already made this series such a success and leaves you inundated, in a good way, with so many activities. It’s fun to play, stunning to watch, and even while writing this all I want to do is jump straight back into it. Whether you’re a fan of racing games or not, Forza Horizon 5 is a must play, as it really is a unique experience.                            
90	                                From its content to the incredible beauty of its representation of Mexico, Forza Horizon 5 offers an experience true to its roots. This 5th installment is already the best racing game you can find.                            
90	                                Forza Horizon 5 is the epitome of the series. It remains firmly rooted on the foundations of Horizon, guarding annoying aspects for some (especially the overplayed tone of all the tracks off), but only raises everything that has already made the salt of the four opuses that have it. preceded. Beautiful to knock down the bumpers, refined to blow a hose, he is a very beautiful baby. It is (very) well on its way to being a system seller in the Xbox ecosystem and I wouldn't be surprised if bundles are coming in very quickly by the end of the year. Anyone who owns a machine capable of running it should have a taste of it.                             
90	                                The Horizon formula has been perfected in Forza Horizon 5. Playground Games has retained what fans loved in previous games, but also offers fine-tuned gameplay and a more diverse open world to explore. This is one of the most fun and polished games of the year, and with continued support and regular content, it has the potential to thrive well into the future.                            
90	                                Forza Horizon 5 caters to all skill levels and approaches, and with its staggering number of missions to complete, things to collect, and fast-paced gameplay, it's an experience that attempts many things and succeeds in all of them with style.                            
90	                                Forza Horizon 5 continues the series’ legacy, usurping Forza Horizon 4 as the new pinnacle of open-world racing and as a graphical showcase for the new generation of Xbox console.                            
90	                                Forza Horizon 5 is a superb racing game. Despite these slight niggles it still manages to put a beaming smile on my face every time I go hurtling off a danger sign, masterfully overtake the leader of a race to snatch the victory, or perfect a drift. It's easily one of the best-looking games on the Xbox Series X, and its extensive roster of cars and events will ensure it's engine keeps quietly ticking over for months on end.                            
90	                                Forza Horizon 5 is undoubtedly the end of a journey that began a long time ago, culminating in the largest and richest chapter ever. Mexico shines and fascinates us, making the wonderful cars we drive even more beautiful.                            
90	                                There may not be much new in Forza Horizon 5 beyond its location, but that doesn't stop it from being yet another action-packed, adrenaline-fuelled open world racing extravaganza. This is the biggest and best entry in the Forza Horizon series yet; it's just lacking that spark of originality that has made each entry prior a clear step up from the one before it. But for the huge majority of players that really won't be an issue. Forza Horizon 4 raised the bar to an impressive height, and Forza Horizon 5 nudges it that bit higher. It's hard to imagine how Playground Games will raise it substantially in a future Forza Horizon entry, but let's hope it does find some magic, or the formula might become a little bit stale.                            
90	                                Forza Horizon 5 is another meaningful evolution of the series as opposed to a reinvention, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's a case of more of the same. Even when it is familiar, Forza Horizon 5 makes small, but thoughtful changes to its established blueprint that hones in on the people behind the cars in a way that the franchise has previously just glossed over. It's not going to convince you to give it a go if Forza Horizon's brand of racing hasn't done it for you in the past, but Forza Horizon 5 still stands head and shoulders above anything else in the genre.                            
90	                                A lot of Forza Horizon 5 feels similar to Forza Horizon 4 in a way previous Horizon games haven’t felt with their prequels, but Adventures bring unique storytelling and slight edutainment to the Horizon formula and if more Horizon’s are in the future, particularly ones not in Europe and America, it’s not a bad foundation to build on. Driving feels as good as it ever has and Playground Games absolutely succeeded in interpreting the beauty of Mexico. The seasonal model returns and it does a better job of incentivizing people to group up, but it’s still not quite enough to entice people to do activities like Forza Arcade.                            
90	                                After five episodes, Playground Games clearly mastered the Forza Horizon formula to the perfection. In both substance and form, the success is total. The game even deploys enough assets to convince beyond car lovers, because the adventure mode offers features that remind us the structure of an action-RPG than of a classic racing game.                            
90	                                Nothing revolutionary in this Forza Horizon 5 but what a pleasure and what generosity. The vistas and ambiance of this Playground Games experience are incredible and provide perfect moments whether for real pilots or less comfortable players, as the game is very accessible…The activities are varied, the landscapes sublime and the sensations at the rendezvous at the wheel of the various vehicles. A delight!                            
90	                                Forza Horizon 5 takes what we’ve loved over the series’ life so far and brings it full circle, with a comprehensive package that includes everything you could possibly want from a racing game. Mexico is an astounding and wonderful location to explore, and production values are on point, from the stunning visuals of its gorgeous open world to the well-executed audio that keeps energy levels high. On top of the diverse range of events we’ve come to expect, Horizon Adventures adds another fun layer of story and player progression that keeps you engaged, and the vehicle handling is, still, second-to-none. With more content than ever before, the Eventlab to make even more experiences and a suite of multiplayer modes to engage with, Forza Horizon 5 is the best racing game available today, bar none.                            
90	                                Playground Games found so many ways to make Mexico come to life, taking great advantage of the region's diversity, while also pushing the Xbox Series X hardware to its limits. If you own the console, you owe it to yourself to check out Forza Horizon 5, whether that means purchasing a copy of the game, or playing it through Xbox Game Pass. It just might be one of the best showpieces for the next-gen era thus far.                            
89	                                Forza Horizon remains the king of arcade racing games, thanks to a lot of driving fun, but also a lot of well-known things.                            
88	                                Forza Horizon 5 improves over its predecessor in almost every way, except that some of its main events aren't as entertaining or spectacular. This is not only a love letter to its Mexican fans, but also a great contender to Game of the Year, because anyone, no matter where they are from, will be able to enjoy this great driving experience.                            
85	                                Forza Horizon 5 is once again beautiful, layered, versatile and unique.                             
85	                                It would be foolish of me to say that Forza Horizon 5 is the best game in the series given my very limited knowledge of its history. However, I can say with confidence this is the most fun I’ve had with a racing game that doesn’t involve a plumber and a princess. There is just so much to do and so much to see that I can easily lose hours of my day exploring all it has to offer. And with continued support from the developers and community, I’ll have no reason to stop playing anytime soon.                            
83	                                Forza Horizon 5 offers plenty to do and see in Mexico, though much of it is becoming rather familiar. The latest entry doesn't have as much impact or innovation as each of its predecessors did, but it remains the most enjoyable and customizable arcade racer around.                            
81	                                Forza Horizon 5 still offers great open world racing fun, looks great and establishes a dimension of freedom in progress that is unique for the genre. But at its core, the game delivers the same mechanics, the same kind of events, just a little bit differently. These wear marks don't make Forza Horizon 5 a bad game, but they make it less appealing.                            
80	                                Forza takes its racing and cars very seriously --with painstaking attention to torque, road conditions and more tuning options than you can shake a gearstick at-- but its raison d’etre is unbridled, uncomplicated driving joy. There is a bewildering amount of stuff that populates the map: traditional races, cross-country sprints, off-road adventures, speed traps, jumps, multiplayer challenges, weekly events. You can barely drive a few yards without something to take part in or smash through. It is bewildering at first and can feel unstructured and scattergun, particularly when the game is throwing XP and rewards at you with so much abandon it's hard to keep track of it all.                            
80	                                An incredible open-world racer that has all the high-octane action you’d possibly want, but a reliance on previous successes makes the game feels somewhat derivative. Whether you should play this or Forza Horizon 4 is literally as much of a coin-flip on which map you’d prefer, and for me, Mexico didn’t hold the charm of flying through the Glenfinnan Viaduct.                            
80	                                Forza Horizon 5 doubles down on the series' winning formula to give players another hit racing game superpowered by next-gen tech.                            
80	                                It may well be more of the same, but Mexico beckons, ravishing the eye and devouring up the miles.                            
80	                                You could spend months in Forza Horizon 5 on a coast-to-coast trip, or dip in for a few days to see the sights and admire the sunsets. The vast array of fun on offer means that whatever you do, wherever you end up, you’ll have a very good time.                            
80	                                Forza Horizon 5 is an amazing game, don’t get us wrong – if you’re a newcomer to the series you’ll likely have a blast, assuming you like car games. Returning fans though can expect a similar experience to past entries. For some, that’s where driver fatigue may very well set in. After five games, at this point, you could argue the series is no longer doing enough to protect its crown as the top open-world racer. It’s the same process of going to a festival, unlocking cars, racing a lot, levelling up and repeating the whole cycle. And the new additions - such as the EventLab - are more reliant on community efforts. It is mostly a flawless experience, but the lack of evolution is how other franchises like Need for Speed fell behind in the first place. If the Forza Horizon series is to continue, it really needs to push the formula to new horizons. It would be great to see Playground really let loose with a future entry, as it's now getting a little too comfortable with the tried and tested template.                            
80	                                Horizon 5 is one of the most technically sound games I have played this year, but it definitely feels lacking in the evolution department.                            
80	                                Forza Horizon 5 delivers everything that made the last game enjoyable on a map that’s more fun to drive with a lot more visual diversity. While the changes and additions are largely incremental—especially when it comes to the core game experience—what’s here is good enough to warrant a recommendation for fans of the series or racing enthusiasts who’ve been meaning to try it out.                            
80	                                I can't tell a lug nut from a spark plug. But Forza Horizon 5's world is so beautiful that I'm more willing to play and learn just so I can continue existing in its dazzling vistas.                            
80	                                It can’t match Forza Horizon 4 in terms of innovations, but Forza Horizon 5 introduces a more varied open-world structure in one of the most visually stunning experiences of this new console generation — perhaps ever.                            
90	                                With a lengthy campaign that supports every aspect of its genre-bending gameplay, The Riftbreaker feels like a momentous big-budget release. Thankfully, its amazing visuals that scale well from less powerful rigs all the way to the latest GPUs keeps its aesthetic an eye-popping selling point across multiple setups. The fact that it can also showcase that graphical prowess on the latest consoles and still provide a refined strategy experience makes this a special entry into the genre. EXOR Studios has delivered a surprisingly great single-player experience that offers dozens of hours of thoughtful play.                            
87	                                The Riftbreaker will throw you on an alien planet both lush and unforgiving, in what could be the perfect mix between a survival RTS and an action/shooter game.                            
85	                                A fantastic game for any base-building fans, The Riftbreaker’s tight combination of action-RPG and tower-defense elements produce an addictively fun experience well worth the inevitable hours you’ll lose to it.                            
85	                                You will surely find in The Riftbreaker one of the most intense and adrenaline-pumping games of recent times.                            
83	                                The Riftbreaker combines the base-building, action-RPG and survivalgenres. That can't work? Oh, it can, and this is the proof.                            
80	                                The Riftbreaker is a chaotic mess that spans several genres and comes out as perfect as Grandma’s Christmas Trifle. It doesn’t make sense at all but it comes together so nicely and seamlessly, it gives the user a completely unique and challenging experience. Whether you are into tower defence, RTS or even bullet hell or hack & slash, The Riftbreaker is going to give you one hell of a wild ride, and you better hang on for dear life.                            
80	                                The Riftbreaker is an addictive, complex, and satisfying RTS/bullet hell hybrid, even while it suffers from some very noticeable performance issues.                            
72	                                The focus placed by The Riftbreaker's gameplay loop on resource management may be too monotonous for some players. It's a game that focuses on its base-building mechanics more than its Action RPG mechanics. Still, it's a decent mixture of both that can either be loved or hated by players.                            
100	                                Metroid Dread is an achievement in every dimension we use to look at it.This exquisite work brings the Metroid formula up to our day, yet itdoesn't compromise on what made Metroid such a colossal name in gaming.With brilliant level design, marvelous looking visuals, frantic anddemanding combat, long lifespan and replay value, perfect performance onany screen, an overarching plot that binds everything together, andpretty much everything else that goes along, Metroid Dread is an instantclassic and one of the finest pieces ever crafted for the NintendoSwitch.                            
100	                                Metroid Dread is a superb mix of action and exploration that brings Nintendo’s classic series into the modern era in a way that feels like a new beginning even as it positions itself as an end to a 35-year saga. Samus, her abilities, and the challenges she faces have changed and expanded over time, but the excitement and satisfaction her adventures provide continue to this day.                            
100	                                The game delivered on its promise in a very big way. As a long-time fan of the franchise, I couldn't be happier with Metroid Dread. It's the kind of game that frequently made me say to myself "just five more minutes" when it was already two o'clock in the morning. Super Metroid is considered by many to be one of the best video games ever made. Gamers will have to judge for themselves if Metroid Dread managed to surpass it, but there's no doubt in my mind that it deserves to be considered among the best games in the series. It has its challenging elements, and they might scare some players off. However, those that stick with the game will be rewarded with one of the year's best experiences.                             
100	                                Metroid Dread takes risks for the series, but it succeeds in doing so. The ending was completely grand, and the interpretations of the final scenes will leave me thinking about the game for a long time to come.                            
100	                                While the nineteen-year hiatus was a difficult one, Metroid Dread delivers what fans have waited for and more, building a familiar yet unique experience with brand new ideas to help push the genre forward.                            
100	                                Metroid Dread is a triumph.                            
100	                                Its playability matched with MercurySteam doing right by Samus Aran has turned me into even more of a fan of Metroid. Even beyond the context of my own affinity toward the character and world, Metroid Dread is some of the most fun I’ve had with a game in 2021. It’s a contender for game of the year.                            
100	                                Metroid Dread is definitely the game that explores the full potential of the 2D franchise with praise, doing justice to the producers' proposal to bring fear and exploration to players, valuing and ending the saga in an excellent way, besides leaving that desire and hope that Samus Aran reward us with more titles with this level of quality in the future. Essential not just for fans of Metroid, but for everyone that likes quality games released in 2021.                            
100	                                Over the years I’ve heard many people demand a sequel, in terms of gameplay, to one 2D Metroid or another. No matter what sequel you’ve wished for, Metroid Dread is it. It is simply Metroid, in the best way possible. Metroid Dread is the culmination of 2D Metroid in its entirety. It is a testament not only to what the genre has always been, but the potential of what it could become. It is a triumphant return of Samus Aran as the undisputed queen of the genre. Long may she reign.                            
100	                                A decades-in-the-making celebration of 2D Metroid that’s unafraid to take risks by stretching into horror, Metroid Dread lives up to both halves of its name and serves as a satisfying cap to a story started in 1986.                            
100	                                This is no Metroid Prime, and that’s a good thing. Rather, this is a reminder of what it means for a game to be of the Metroid half of a Metroidvania, and then some. That this IP exists in both the first-person genre-defining Metroid Prime series, and in its traditional 2D side-scrolling self is a testament to its flexibility and EMMI-like defiance of not being confined to a single shape...And in Metroid Dread, you’re not only getting arguably the best Metroid game to date, but maybe the best game of 2021.                            
100	                                Metroid Dread is an instant classic. Its seamless blend of exploration, combat, puzzle-solving, and light touches of story creates one of the most engaging experiences on Nintendo Switch.                            
100	                                Metroid Dread perfects the metroidvania formula that its predecessors established, while also elevating the series to new heights with highly rewarding combat, stunning 3D cutscenes and new stealth segments that provide greater variety to the gameplay. It won’t be for everyone due to its high difficulty and a lack of accessibility options, but this is nevertheless one of the best games in the Nintendo Switch library. If you’re a fan of Super Metroid, you’ll love it.                             
100	                                With a near-perfect balance of nods to the past and fresh ideas, Metroid Dread brings cinematic flair, fast-paced action and a surprising story to the side-scrolling classic. This is the comeback fans have been waiting for.                            
100	                                Metroid Dread is a triumphant return for both Samus Aran and developer MercurySteam. This is a super-slick, hugely entertaining and exquisitely designed entry in the Metroid franchise that plays better than anything we've seen from the series so far. With a bunch of fantastic new abilities, super tense and enjoyable stealth sections, plenty of great big boss fights and a story that fans will definitely enjoy, we can't really see how this one could have been any better. Best Metroid game ever? This could be the one.                            
96	                                Probably the game that I have enjoyed the most in this 2021 and one of my favorites from the wide catalog of the Nintendo Switch. MercurySteam did it and Samus is back better than ever.                             
95	                                Overall though, Metroid Dread is excellent. MercurySteam has more than proven themselves to be a worthy steward of the 2D Metroid games. They understand the genre and what fans are looking for from Nintendo’s bounty hunter extraordinaire. Metroid Dread is simply a must-play title for newcomers and fans alike.                            
95	                                Metroid Dread is a masterpiece. There's hardly another word for it. The artstyle? Phenomenal. Soundtrack and audio design? Phenomenal. Gameplay? You guessed it: phenomenal. What are you waiting for? Go and get it!                            
95	                                Metroid Dread is the title fans have been waiting for, for nineteen years. The wait wasn’t easy, but what’s here could rival even Super Metroid in terms of atmosphere and gameplay. Even now, I am thinking about going back to try and perfect my run and see how fast I can get that hundred percent clear. Through its versatility in combat, excellent enemy and level design, and engaging story, this experience sets the bar for the action genre and is brilliantly dreadful.                            
95	                                For as fantastic as Dread looks and generally runs, there are infrequent but quite noticeable instances when the framerate drops. It's also mildly annoying how long the transitions are from one area to another. While these are criticisms worth noting, they almost feel petty when compared to the staggering amount of things that the game crushes. Honestly, it's a relief that Metroid is finally getting the kind of care it so justly deserves. Metroid Dread is the very definition of a must-play title.                            
95	                                For 15 years I have been waiting for this game, and to see it out and also be as good as I hoped it would be is simply incredible. The gameplay is sublime, the map design is great, the bosses are fun and the E.M.M.I are threatening. All these come together to create what possible is: The Nintendo Switch's 2021 game of the year.                            
95	                                Metroid Dread is an amazing return for Samus with fantastic controls, excellent sound design and a wonderful overall aesthetic. Even as someone who’s not normally fond of Metroidvania-style games, the intensity of Metroid Dread held my attention to the point where I felt heartbroken the first time my Switch let me know the batteries were about to die.                            
95	                                Metroid Dread is the sequel that everyone has been waiting for. A great game that can be hard and complex, but at its core, it's a true evolution of the classic Metroid formula. A must have for every Nintendo Switch user.                            
95	                                This final 13-16 hour instalment is an exquisite showcase of 2D Metroid in its prime. Newcomers and die-hard fans of the series can revel in a Nintendo Switch game that not only provides one of the most deadly and thrilling experiences on Nintendo’s latest handheld to date, but one that’s such a joy to play thanks to control refinements and HD graphics. Metroid Dread is an explosive and emotional end to a beloved story that cannot be missed, and we’re already itching to see where the next mission takes us. Just as long as it doesn’t include the dreaded E.M.M.I.                            
94	                                Another must-have Switch exclusive, and a modern reminder why the mother of the Metroidvania sub-genre still demands attention.                            
93	                                Metroid Dread convincingly shows that Samus Aran is, after so many years, still at the (or very near to) the top of the genre it helped define. MercurySteam's creation is exhilarating, well balanced and beautiful to look at; even the somewhat atypical E.M.M.I. sections are competently integrated with the rest of the game.                            
92	                                Metroid Dread is one of the games of the year. The waiting time after Fusion was worth it, and this sequel lives up to it. The title has great pacing, cool design, and plenty of mechanics that modernize Samus. This game serves to highlight two things: Samus Returns, and MercurySteam.                            
91	                                Although we have yet to even see Prime 4, I have no trepidations saying that if the series sticks to 2D in the future, this is the mold—the perfect mix of classic and modern mechanics and pacing. You owe yourself the opportunity to play this game. Dread is a powerful reminder of the importance and quality of one of Nintendo’s greatest franchises.                            
91	                                An excellent return for Samus Aran and the Metroid series. The novelties don't work perfectly, but they are interesting nonetheless.                            
91	                                Metroid Dread is the comeback we have been dreaming about for years. There is some room for improvement, but overall it’s an incredibly solid game and a must-buy for any Metroid (or metroidvania) fan.                            
91	                                Metroid Dread is a truly exceptional return to the spotlight for the franchise and Samus Aran.                            
90	                                There’s little to complain about when it comes to Metroid’s glorious comeback. The game could be longer and introduce a few more innovations, but in every other aspect, it is a long-awaited return to the roots of the beloved franchise. And we love it!                            
90	                                Even with Samus Returns under their belt, I'll admit to being slightly worried that MercurySteam wouldn't be able to live up to the standards set by Sakamoto's original Metroid crew at Nintendo R&D1. With Dread, my worries proved to be unfounded! This is a magnificent new benchmark for the franchise! [Issue #56 – November/December 2021, p. 66]                            
90	                                Upon investigating a mysterious transmission on Planet ZDR, Samus faces a mysterious foe that traps her in this dangerous world. The remote planet has been overrun by vicious alien lifeforms and murderous robots called E.M.M.I. Hunt or be hunted as you make your way through a labyrinth of enemies in Samus’ most intense side-scrolling adventure yet.                             
90	                                While it may not win over every fan of classic 2D Metroid, MercurySteam’s approach keeps Dread from feeling like a rehash of what we’ve grown accustomed to. The map design and pacing have never been better, and Dread’s stellar combat justifies MercurySteam’s action-heavy overhaul to the series. Ultimately, Dread was worth waiting two decades for. If this is the way forward for Samus — and, with additional accessibility options, I sincerely hope it is — Metroid has a bright future ahead.                            
90	                                Metroid Dread takes everything that's good about the franchise and makes it greater. It's a punishing and often nerve-wracking experience that offers huge rewards for persistence and an inquisitive mind. If you only play one game on Nintendo Switch this year, make sure it's Metroid Dread.                            
90	                                So far, Metroid Dread is a serious contender for my personal game of the year. It takes all the things that I loved about previous entries and streamlines them into a much more playable game. It’s the most accessible Metroid title to date, and it’s sure to win many new fans for Nintendo.                            
90	                                Plot beats provide a frame for the action, not a psychological character study. Rather, what lingers in the mind are the tight controls, the inspired boss fights and the fantastic layout of the environments. Metroid Dread deftly alternates between making the player feel powerful and powerless.                            
90	                                MercurySteam, after being "baptized in battle" with Metroid: Samus Returns, delivers a superb game with Metroid Dread, a captivating, fresh take on the Metroid franchise, that is also true to the vision of the old games. Either you are a fan of Samus Aran or not, this is a "metroidvania" you should not miss out.                            
90	                                Overall, Metroid Dread brings a narrative close to a decades long story with excellent level design and combat. It also looks great as well. So until Samus Aran is needed once again to save the Galactic Federation, I am happy to just savour the joy of another successfully completed mission.                            
90	                                It takes a lot of risks in service of creating its specific feel, but as long as you’re okay with having conventions challenged within a conventional framework, this should be an easy pick-up.                            
90	                                I won't be surprised if Metroid Dread gets crowned Game of the Year. If that happens, I'll be happy. Dread is a furiously frustrating, extremely challenging, and superbly satisfying game, and probably the best Metroid ever.                            
90	                                Strong gameplay, visuals and audio propel Metroid Dread to be the best 2D game in the series, though dated map design and lack of accessibility bring the experience down a bit.                            
90	                                Metroid Dread is nerve wrecking, intense and immensely satisfying.                            
90	                                Metroid finally returns with a new sequel, and it’s exactly what we expect from the series. It’s a fine return to form for Samus with a huge world to explore but definitely doesn’t reinvent the wheel.                            
90	                                Metroid Dread stands as a phenomenal achievement. From project dormancy to becoming a sci-fi spectacle, MercurySteam has delivered a Game of the Year contender that’s quite capable of unleashing a Charge Blast to keep away the competition. A game like this deserves to be celebrated, and I can only hope that it has continued to lay the groundwork for more adventures with the intergalactic bounty hunter to come.                            
90	                                The first all-new 2D Metroid in 19 years was well worth the wait. Its movement, combat, and environments are all top-notch, and the pacing will keep you hooked all the way through the end. The story is a wild ride that expands on interesting ideas from Fusion and Samus Returns in meaningful ways. There are a few technical hiccups, frustrating level design choices, and repeated mini-bosses, but my enthusiasm was never swayed thanks to a steady stream of exciting and memorable moments that kept my hands glued to the controller until the credits rolled. Dread is a stellar sequel to Fusion and a triumphant return that easily ranks among the best in the 2D series.                            
90	                                Metroid Dread is yet another fantastic return to form for Samus. ZDR is an absolute blast to explore with secrets everywhere and satisfying bosses to fight. However, the game is held back by some strange design decisions, areas that blend together, and controls that are far too complicated.                            
90	                                We’ve seen Metroidvania games like Hollow Knight nail the formula in recent years, but Metroid Dread proves there’s nothing better than the franchise that started it all.                            
90	                                Metroid Dread is a fantastic return to form for the 2D Metroid titles. Building upon the lessons of Samus Returns, it captures the feel of Metroid nearly perfectly. It's incredibly fun to play, balances the story and gameplay in the way a Metroid game should, and in general, it's just excellent. Its few flaws stood out more in retrospect than while I was playing the game. It's easily one of the best 2D Metroid titles, and it's a fantastic way to close out the ongoing storyline.                            
90	                                Metroid Prime 4 may still be years away, but make no mistake that MercurySteam and Nintendo’s latest incarnation of Metroid has made the strain of such a wait not just more bearable, but potentially no longer existent. Sure to please longtime fans and general Switch owners/newcomers alike, Metroid Dread more than delivers on a climax two decades in the making.                            
90	                                In very much a Metroidvania move, backtracking back to the start of the review with the question, "Is the new adventure worth the wait?" The answer is a resounding yes. Nintendo and MercurySteam have pulled off a sequel that is classic, essential Metroid with a sprinkling of the new; controls, visual direction and a terrifying new threat that sends a space-aged shiver through the spine. Metroid Dread is the evolution to how side-scrolling Metroid should feel and the conclusion to something truly special. A thrilling chapter for players who have been looking up to the stars for decades, and a compelling tale for adventurers new to the series!                            
90	                                Anyway, all these negatives really only stand out if you place Dread in the pantheon of previous Metroid classics and then compare very closely. Because what I mainly want to communicate is that those Spaniards have done the impossible: creating a really good, classic Metroid! And that in a world in which the term metroidvania hardly raises any question marks. With production values of 2021, wow! So make a few more, MercurySteam; I promise I will never doubt you again. And… please don't take twenty years, okay?                            
90	                                Metroid Dread is a must-own for any Metroidvania fan. Featuring some of the best 2D combat I’ve ever played and a world dying to be explored, I couldn’t put it down until I reached the thrilling conclusion. Its difficulty and atmosphere help it live up to its namesake but never chased me away. There are minor issues, but nothing that stops this from being one of 2021’s best.                            
90	                                Samus Aran's triumphant return to a genre that she herself helped to name proves once again that there are no styles worthy of being caged in the past. The risk taken by MercurySteam results in one of the best games ever in the series, a chapter with its own personality that puts the bounty hunter alongside Link and Mario, making it one of the console's must-have titles. From the memorable bosses, to the harrowing encounters with the E.M.M.I. all painted by an artistic direction that takes the most from Nintendo Switch, making Metroid Dread one of the best of 2021.                            
90	                                Nintendo teams up again with MercurySteam to bring us the first unreleased adventure of Samus Aran in side scrolling (remakes aside) since the premiere of Metroid Fusion in 2002. The pressure was not little, but Metroid Dread is up to the task. For the control, which lets us handle the bounty hunter in her most agile and precise version; by the design, which branches and extends to offer hours of exploration without taking us by the hand; and for the selection of bosses, who take advantage of the best combat of the saga in its 2D aspect. The robots E.M.M.I. They may test the patience of some players, but they create situations of genuine tension and development doses them enough. So fans of Metroidvania are in luck: Metroid Dread lives up to the saga that popularized this genre in the first place. Now we only have to ask that we don't have to wait another 19 years for the next one.                             
90	                                Metroid Dread surpasses all our expectations and has everything we could have ask for: exploration, impressive action sequences, great atmosphere, tension and the best Samus incarnation. If we look at it as a metroidvania it doesn't reach the same level of greatness as some of the finest examples of the genre... But it comes close.                            
90	                                Metroid Dread combines the old, trusted Metroid formula with enough fresh ideas to revive the 35-year-old series. Never before has Samus been so fluidly controlled and the action so spectacular. The EMMI is an exciting break from standard exploration, but every part of Metroid is equally well thought out. However, optional upgrades hardly add anything in most cases and it doesn't want to be as free as Super Metroid. They are minor missteps for a game that puts Metroid back on the map.                            
90	                                Metroid Dread sharpens everything that makes Metroid enjoyable, while more fully realizing its horror ambitions.                            
90	                                It took a bit longer than expected, but Metroid Dread simply is Metroid at its finest: with a smartly crafted level design that explains why this legendary saga became a reference point, this new Samus’ adventure embodies all the features Metroid fans love.                            
90	                                Metroid Dread for the Nintendo Switch is a worthy holder of the title "Metroid 5." Its sprawling world begs you to explore every inch of it, and while it keeps Samus Returns' control elements, they feel much better on the Switch. This is a proper Metroid 5, and that's more than enough to make it an Editors’ Choice pick for Switch games.                            
90	                                Metroid Dread is pure love for the franchise. It takes the elements of the classic 2D games and unites them with the evolving essence of Metroid Fusion, introducing many others that work perfectly. It doesn't give off such a magical aura and there are things to improve, but it establishes itself as one of the best games on the console.                            
90	                                One of the best Metroid games ever made and a thrilling restatement of everything that makes the series, and the genre it inspired, great.                            
90	                                Metroid Dread is exceptional in every way, placing itself as one of the best episodes in a series that already has no shortage of nuggets! By mixing the phases of action and infiltration, the game developed by Mercury Studios constantly keeps the player in suspense. But beyond its structure and its exploration aspect, it is the fluidity of the gameplay that stuck us to the ceiling, with a Samus more agile and twirling than ever and a difficulty that forces us to juggle these many capacities in many situations. Whether you are a newbie or a fan of the series, Metroid Dread is a must-have for any Nintendo Switch owner.                             
90	                                A surprise sequel after nearly 20 years, Metroid Dread brings back the legendary exploration and progression and merges it with excellent modern combat and some of the best boss fights ever.                            
90	                                We never felt so powerful in a Metroid game, but at the same time the E.M.M.I. robots keep the tension high. This is a great conclusion and an explosive return, and hopefully not the last time we see Nintendo's most famous bounty hunter in a 2D adventure.                            
90	                                After 19 years, Nintendo finally delivers an official sequel to Metroid Fusion that concludes Samus Aran's lifelong battle with a race of deadly alien organisms.                            
90	                                I am, on the whole, delighted to report that Metroid Dread is every bit as good as the fans had hoped it would be, delivering a stunning conclusion that lays the groundwork for a very exciting future. It's a masterfully executed, explosive action game that delivers on every level, and looks and feels exactly how a Metroid game should in 2021. There are eye-popping vistas, moments of sheer terror, and some of the most memorable - and challenging - boss battles in the series' 35-year history.                             
90	                                Metroid Dread is the return of Samus we waited for almost twenty years. The closing chapter of Samus' adventure is intended to kickstart the era of the Switch OLED and it does it with a bang. The game looks delicious and plays seamlessly smooth. The game has some minor flaws but feels nearly perfect as you search the depths of ZDR and need to flee the E.M.M.I. to save your life. This is simply a must-buy for everyone that owns a Switch.                            
90	                                In so many ways it is a return to what makes Metroid such a fantastic series of games. The EMMI chase segments are a welcome addition and add a new twist to its classic gameplay. The boss fights are more epic than ever, and the story is such a sweet payoff for fans that have invested literal decades in the overall series’ lore. There are a number of reasons they named the first half of an entire genre of games after this franchise and so many of them are on display here.                            
90	                                Metroid Dread has been decades in the making, and if that’s because it wasn’t possible on less powerful handhelds, it’s been well and truly worth the wait.                            
90	                                Metroid Dread suffers from some minor grievances, but overall it is a remarkable achievement in not just resurrecting a dormant and beloved series, proving its authority in the genre it inhabits, or exhibiting the kind of airtight design we’d expect from a title of this calibre. It is a remarkable achievement because it is one of those few rare games that sets itself an atmospheric goal and launches it towards and through the stratosphere. This, here, is one of 2021’s very best games - we’re always in for a treat when Samus returns.                            
90	                                Metroid Dread sees the galaxy's best bounty hunter return in fine form. It takes the terror of being hunted from Metroid Fusion, the more modern direction of Samus Returns, and the freedom to add to the series' decades of lore to create something that's nigh on essential for Metroid fans.                            
90	                                Metroid Dread is a perfect mixture of 'things'. It is obviously a Metroidvania, but it can be enjoyed both by the connoisseurs of the genre as well as those that are complete newbies to it, it can even be considered a proper place to start exploring the genre. Even I, someone who is not particularly a fan of the Metroidvania concept, have been delighted by what Metroid Dread has to offer, and it has provided me with a ton of joy and has also surprised me more than any other game in a long time.                            
90	                                Metroid Dread is a wonderful, modern take on a classic game from childhood. It looks as beautiful as any of today’s games, but has a feel of the games of old. The scary tone of the game and its intense foes give you a challenge worthy of the series.                            
90	                                A continuation of Samus’ story from Metroid Fusion, Metroid Dread excels as a hybrid of both classic and modern Metroid gameplay. The exploration and combat are top-notch, with satisfying boss fights complete with stunning graphics and mid-action cutscenes. It’s only a few nitpicks that prevent Dread from being a masterpiece, but that still means that it’s a must-have for Metroid fans. The future holds a lot of promise for Samus Aran.                            
90	                                Metroid Dread is the final chapter of the journey started by Samus Aran on NES long ago. Developer MecurySteam has managed to create a game loyal to the series but full of new elements added to renew the gameplay. Being chased by E.M.M.I. is one of the most terrifying experiences you could ever feel in a videogame. It’s just a brilliant addiction. Exploring ZDR planet is a marvelous adventure: as you progress through the game, you will collect new powers and story elements. Metroid Dread feels like old and new at the same time: will please both fans of the series and new players. This game plays gorgeously on the new Switch OLED screen and is a must-have for every metroidvania addict.                            
90	                                With Metroid Dread, Mercury Steam brings the series back to its roots by delivering a strong, dense and cleverly designed 2D episode. Thanks to its tough but balanced curve, Samus keeps getting stronger and more able to decipher many puzzles and fight interesting bosses, only to appear vulnerable when escaping the new EMMI robots. The adventure sure is classic, but all the elements here are pushed to their limits, for the better. What a ride.                            
90	                                Metroid Dread is nearly the perfect return for Samus, and only some difficulty spikes rain on the parade. This is a tight, responsive 2D Metroid experience that constantly impresses and surprises in equal measure and is the perfect way to launch the new Switch model.                            
89	                                Metroid Dread is one of the best Metroidvania games out there with its awesome collection of abilities and its action-packed E.M.M.I. areas. It may not provide as much challenge as old-school fans would expect but it's still an undeniably incredible adventure.                            
88	                                Metroid Dread proves that the Metroid franchise is still ready to innovate the genre it helped build with exciting new ideas. While it hasn't taken on all the lessons from newcomers that have filled in since its absence, it doesn't feel like an outsider looking in.                            
88	                                Metroid games have always had trace elements of sci-fi horror in them, and Metroid Dread is no different. Rather than inject the series with new levels of fear and tension, Dread seeks to highlight the latent spookiness already present. To that end, it works! That familiar sense of powerlessness and fear is given new life in this game. Suddenly your initial state of weakness has greater narrative weight. Furthermore, the lateral expansion of your move set feels like a natural conclusion. Every victory is one you clawed and fought for with all your might. Each new stage is filled with fresh dangers to keep you moving with an abundance of caution and care. Even the complex controls and the punishing boss fights are in service to this vision. Metroid Dread takes small, but significant, steps to expand and innovate upon the established series formula. Metroid and Metroidvania fans alike won't want to miss this entry.                            
86	                                Well-designed metroidvania elements, prominent storyline and dynamic action – Metroid Dread delivers on almost every front. [Issue#255, p.28]                            
85	                                Metroid Dread is the pinnacle and full maturity of the series that began in 1986. Metroid Dread is a collection of handcraft mechanics from previous installments, offering the definitive 2D Metroid experience.                             
85	                                Metroid Dread is not only an excellent game and return of a beloved franchise, it’s emblematic of everything that defined the genre in the first place in a way that many modern Metroidvanias simply aren’t. Its exploration, upgrading, and re-exploration are never spoonfed to you and feel constantly like great accomplishments with great difficulty scaling and thrilling new mechanics and atmosphere.                            
85	                                With Metroid Dread, Mercury Steam brings a satisfying conclusion to 35 years of history. It's a particularly solid metroidvania, which will make you thrill at every revelation and sweat at every boss fight, while distilling a level-design mastered like never before. However, its main and only innovation, embodied by the E.M.M.I., prevents the title from reaching the pantheon of the genre, which is already full of quality titles: more frustrating than stressful, the mechanics and areas related to the robots of the galactic federation are far from convincing us.                            
85	                                25 years after the start of the 2D saga, Samus is in perfect shape and has tied us to the Switch for many hours.                            
85	                                Metroid Dread feels like a celebration of 2D Metroid. It manages to stay true to the original games, whilst also introducing some new elements that keeps things feeling fresh. The game is held back by some questionable level design, the E.M.M.I feeling repetitive and a definite knowledge barrier for series newcomers.                             
85	                                An intoxicating power climb, top-notch level design and a fear-inducing hook make this an incredibly compelling and long overdue side-scrolling Metroid sequel. It struggles with sticking too closely to the roots of its decades-old predecessors and could definitely learn a thing or two from contemporary Metroidvanias, but it's a blast all the same.                            
85	                                Metroid Dread doesn't take a lot of big swings, but it rarely bats a foul ball.                            
85	                                Metroid Dread is a dignified sequel to a sacred games series. The almost invincible E.M.M.I. can be annoying, but other than that, you get a fully-fleshed metroidvania that combines new mechanics with traditional Metroid gameplay in the best sense.                            
83	                                Although not without some frustrating moments, Metroid Dread is a great experience, offering up an engrossing journey full of engaging exploration and challenging combat that is proof alone that 2D Metroid is worthy of a renaissance.                            
80	                                A perfect organism? Not quite, but in its finest stretches Dread has a momentum that can mesmerise for hours at a time. It's hard to look away from the screen - even when, in moments that reach towards full horror, you might want to. [Issue#365, p.98]                            
80	                                19 years. That's how long fans had to wait for a real sequel to the 2D adventures of intergalactic bounty hunter Samus Aran. And as it turns out: it’s worth the wait. Dread is excellent, hardcore and a beautiful love letter to the genre. The terrifying Extraplanetary Multiform Mobile Identifiers (E.M.M.I's) are refreshing and make the title chillingly true. The somewhat retro visual flair pops, but mostly on the new (and more expensive) OLED Switch.                            
80	                                Metroid Dread offers the same old "Metroidvania" concept as before, but also adds completely new exciting and surprising features. The "just one more try" feeling is also constant and does not let go of us until we have really managed to unlock everything.                             
80	                                If you are somehow infected with the Metroid series, you do not need these lines to play this game. No, even if you're playing for the first time, Metroid Dread can be a good choice to see what kind of dynamism the series has.                            
80	                                Samus Aran's latest 2D mission boasts consistently high thrills in exploration and combat to provide a worthy sequel to a highly-regarded game that came out 19 years ago. Metroid Dread doesn't quite deliver on the "dread" promised in the title, with atmosphere lacking and the initially-tense EMMI encounters becoming predictable, but nonetheless we had a tremendous amount of fun and hope we don't face another 19-year wait for the next original entry.                            
80	                                Where the studio succeeds—and where Metroid Dread elevates from noble and flawed effort to inspired riff—is in its embrace of the unreachable.                            
80	                                Metroid Dread is hard, but it's hard in a really good way. The kind of way that makes you sometimes want to toss your controller, but doubles your resolve while doing so. It's smooth, quick, and makes Samus feel fast and powerful as much as it possibly can without turning into an action platformer.                            
80	                                Metroid Dread is an excellent return to the Samus saga with an interesting story and solid mechanics, although it does have a few problems with its new villains.                            
80	                                The game perfects the 2D trappings of Metroid’s mechanics and hands players so much freedom when it comes to exploration.                            
80	                                Metroid Dread isn't a groundbreaking genre piece, and it's not trying to be one. New game lead by Yoshio Sakamoto is aimed at those players, who can appreciate fine-tuned and deep gameplay.                            
80	                                Metroid has officially returned to its pedestal of greatness among Nintendo's finest. Powerfully efficient in its details and ruthless in its effort to make the player writhe in agony. While not the greatest heights the franchise has ever seen, it's more than polished enough to be a respected and beloved addition to the franchise. While it marks the end of the original timeline, the future is vast and endless, and Dread marks the potential for a markedly improved vision of the genre. While the Switch has more than enough must-buys already, this is yet another. Just be warned that it takes no prisoners.                            
80	                                It’s terrific stuff, though it may prove a little strenuous for newcomers at times. Metroid has always been one of Nintendo’s more ‘hardcore’ pursuits and Dread looks to make a virtue of this in a challenging and often esoteric adventure. But whether you are new or a Metroid old-hand, there is no doubting the craft here.  A welcome return for one of gaming’s most stylish heroes.                            
80	                                Metroid Dread is a slick and intense platform-adventure, and the most exciting Switch game Nintendo has produced in quite some time.                            
80	                                Metroid Dread doesn't break the mold, but it's a solid Metroidvania that will please fans new and old alike.                            
80	                                It's a cliché, but Metroid Dread won't be a game for everyone. If you like a game that doesn't hold your hand at all, is brutally difficult, requires precision from every movement and busts your back, you'll love Samus' latest mission. If not, your experience will vary depending on how much you can put up with the genre’s pitfalls and what might be considered obtuse design decisions. Metroid Dread almost broke me several times, but it might just be what you're after. It took a while, but Samus is back, and hopefully not going away for so long this time.                            
80	                                Metroid Dread is likely to give those that have been counting down the days to its release exactly what they want: a thrilling experience in line with what they loved about past games. There are original ideas here - but they’re better considered as evolutions of what came before rather than anything groundbreaking. There’s stumbles here and there with the difficulty and progression signposting, but all of that feels very Metroid. Dread is no Super Metroid, but that game is a stone-cold all-timer. Putting that game aside, Dread is up to the series standard, and is well worth a look.                            
80	                                More than anything else, Metroid Dread feels like going back to a place of comfort after a long time away. Though the gameplay is refined and new features have been added to the mix, Dread sticks closely to the formula of its predecessors. In the end, for longtime fans like myself, that's probably for the best. There's nothing to dread here. We're home again.                            
78	                                Metroid Dread is an experience that is at times deeply enjoyable and yet imperfect at the same time. MercurySteam certainly did not lack the courage to take risks, proposing new ideas, exceptional dynamism and surprising horror veins: elements that fit coherently within a winning formula, tested over the last thirty-five years. A few too many smudges - probably the result of a production not up to the height of Nintendo's heavyweights - however, end up making the whole thing miss: with some extra ideas, less repetition and a little more character in artistic terms, the result could have been be different and even more rounded. However, it is always fascinating to find Samus on our screens, in a franchise that deserves more than it usually gets (starting with the Big N).                             
75	                                “Dread” might not be the next big leap forward for the “Metroid” franchise or side-scrolling gaming as a whole, but at the same time, it’s hard to imagine that existing fans (or just about anyone else who likes the game genre that “Metroid” helped pioneer) won’t get a huge kick out of the series’ long-overdue return. The last few years have led to a minor renaissance for side-scrolling action games and though “Metroid” might not be the uncontested gold standard for the genre anymore, “Dread” confirms that the aging franchise is still among the best in the business.                            
70	                                I simply don’t think this stands as tall as Super Metroid, Zero Mission, Prime, Fusion, or even Samus Returns. But to a Metroid fan it is worth playing and realize that these are problems I found with the game; other people haven’t had the same issues. However, to anyone who has never played a Metroid game before, I don’t think this is the place to start. I think it feels too different from the rest of the series (neither a good or bad thing) and the moments in the story that hit really well only do so because of everything that has happened before in previous titles.                            
70	                                A bit fastidious sometimes, often original, Metroid Dread is kinda stuck between two worlds. Handling the game is counter-intuitive, but there's some great new additions and you'll find a well balanced difficulty. The game brings a new slice of mythology that has been expected forever now.                            
70	                                Metroid Dread is a good Metroid-style game, but does little more.                            
70	                                Frustrating boss battles and cumbersome controls distract from an otherwise fun and isolating adventure.                            
70	                                I left Metroid Dread feeling quite conflicted about it. On the one hand, I do think it is fundamentally well designed, and the main gameplay element - the robot stalkers - are woven into the Metroid formula beautifully. On the other hand, that Metroid formula is getting long in the tooth and Dread doesn't do nearly enough to revitalise it. Dread is fine. It's not just nearly memorable enough for a game that fans have been waiting so many years for now.                            
60	                                Perhaps I am asking too much. We don’t pry for depth from Mario as he rescues his princess, or ask what motivates Tom Nook in his real estate empire. Like pretty much all Nintendo’s games, with their long legacies and perfect jumps, this feel good to play, and that should be enough: but I don’t come to a Nintendo title for enough. I left Dread feeling that perhaps the real legacy of 2D Metroid will be the games it inspires, rather than the games themselves.                            
50	                                Metroid Dread can't commit to giving players an action-packed power fantasy or a suspenseful adventure against the odds. It's quick, short, and snappy -- all things that can be good when used right, but not at all what Metroid Dread set out to deliver.                            
90	                                In particular, it looks back fondly at the NES trilogy and updates the mechanics, structure, story, and gameplay, all while retaining that traditional turn-based combat and wonderful music. Even the sometimes frustrating dungeons and bosses stick around for much-needed reminders of the good old days. Because of this, Final Fantasy V has a unique spirit amongst the other Super Famicom/SNES titles. VI does have some elements of customisation, and IV has its moments of silliness, but the core of V is to embrace the fun and experimentation and lose yourself in the adventure. Sometimes, I forget to do that when I’m playing a video game, particularly a Final Fantasy game. So, for that alone, I’m glad I gave the Pixel Remaster of Final Fantasy V a chance.                            
90	                                Final Fantasy V Pixel Remaster gives one of the franchises’ underdogs a substantial glow-up, in many ways realizing its potential in ways the original hardware or previous ports never could. Series fans should not miss the opportunity to experience it here, if they’ve never played it before.                            
80	                                Quotation forthcoming.                            
80	                                Final Fantasy V Pixel Remaster is a game that should not be missed by JRPG lovers with its customizable job system and successfully developed features.                            
80	                                As much as I loved playing through the Final Fantasy V Pixel Remaster, I can’t call it the definitive version. A definitive version would have the GBA bonus content, the PS1 cutscenes, the option to switch graphics and music, and multiple difficulties. But what we have is a beautiful version of a JRPG classic that has not been widely distributed outside of Japan. It’s an amazing game that holds up really well today. So, if anyone from Square-Enix is reading this review, please release the Final Fantasy Pixel Remasters on console, with physical editions. I would buy the heck outta that.                            
80	                                With its lighter adventure and rich job system, Final Fantasy V retains its original charm with this Pixel Remaster edition. If the title benefits from graphics and a neat soundtrack like its predecessors, we can still deplore its cleaving font or the absence of content added with the Advance version. Despite everything, the greatest strength of this Final Fantasy V Pixel Remaster remains to finally make available in French the lesser known episode of the Super NES trilogy.                             
80	                                While the Final Fantasy Pixel Remasters aren’t perfect, they’re certainly the best and most convenient ways to play these classic games. The soundtracks are lovingly orchestrated and the pixel art is gorgeous, though the latter does lose some detail in the translation. Each game feels great to play, but I do wish extra content from previous releases or remakes had been included.                            
80	                                Final Fantasy V is one of the more overlooked titles in the franchise, but skipping this title would be a mistake. Its story may not reach some of the highs as other entries in the franchise, but it’s still compelling enough to keep players interested. While it might not have the best Final Fantasy story, however, it has one of the best job systems. There’s grinding involved to get some of the exceptional abilities, but the freedom to customize a party however the player wants offers many opportunities for creative party configurations and encourages multiple playthroughs. Final Fantasy V Pixel Remaster updates a great classic JRPG in a way that respects the original 16-bit title, bringing enough changes to make it feel updated but keeping it familiar enough to appeal to long-time fans.                            
75	                                If you have never had the chance to play Final Fantasy V before, the Pixel Remaster offers great value. This is a good version of a great game that shows clearly why Square is highly regarded for their expertise in RPGs. However, as a long-time fan of the game and the series, I sincerely wish they had gone the extra mile into making this version the most comprehensive and definitive edition it deserves.                            
70	                                Final Fantasy V Pixel Remaster reminded me of just how fun the older Final Fantasy titles were. It will potentially be something of a hit-or-miss for die-hard fans of the original entry, with its poor user interface and reimagined pixel artwork. However, this is a great a time as ever for newcomers to check this classic entry in the Final Fantasy series out. As it offers a fair amount of quality of life improvements that will appeal to modern sensibilities and make the game easier to pick up and play.                            
100	                                The very best minigames and boards throughout the Mario Party series have been brought together and recreated for some truly hilarious good times. While I wish there were even more boards to choose from, the game is still plenty of fun whether you're playing locally with friends or online with others.                            
100	                                Even non-gamers will find this easy to enjoy. Great family fun.                            
96	                                If you’ve ever had an interest in Mario and his friends or you love board games or mini games… this is really a simple choice… grab a copy and have fun!                            
95	                                Mario Party Superstars is the culmination of all that is great about the Mario Party series. Sporting many of the best boards and mini-games pulled from the series’ long history and featuring multiple quality-of-life updates including online play, the ability to save and return to a game later, faster gameplay, a variety of different playstyles between the boards, a leveling system, and a ton of items to unlock, Mario Party Superstars may be the best entry yet in the long-running series. Here’s hoping Nintendo supports this release and adds new boards in future DLC.                            
95	                                Mario Party Superstars completely rebuilds some of the Nintendo 64 era’s best Mario Party boards of varying difficulty and gives them a gorgeous modern veneer. The game plays exactly as you’d expect from a Mario Party with smooth yet simple controls. The frustrations stem. from the fact that your opponents can benefit from the same perks that just helped you take a lead, equating to more first-to-last-place moments than Mario Kart itself. A lot of the older mini-games can end in a matter of seconds so if you’re playing it mostly for the mini-games, it can be a bit of a letdown when a game ends in under five seconds.                            
90	                                The Switch has no shortage of multiplayer games, but there's a strong case that Mario Party Superstars is among the best on the platform. I've had more fun with it than I've had in a long time, even with laggy internet and the occasional spammy random. It's some of the best of Mario Party, and I only hope we see even more added to it in the coming months.                            
90	                                Mario Party Superstars is a comeback tour for the series, a love letter to frantic marathon runs and celebrates Mario Party in a truly spectacular way. An impressive package that's stitched together with striking visuals, an upgraded soundtrack and robust online play.                            
90	                                If you can look past the rotating control stick games, and if developer NDcube can offer new content and refine the game over time, you’re likely to enjoy this party for years to come.                            
90	                                Mario Party Superstars is the ultimate celebration of the franchise on Nintendo Switch. It takes the best minigames from past entries and creates a game that looks beautiful. New animations, useful features, and a very good online multiplayer makes this entry in the series the best Mario Party ever created.                            
90	                                Mario Party Superstar's online mode boosts the game up to the point that it becomes the most well-rounded entry of the series. It is something that players had been looking for many years now, and it completely matches expectations.                             
90	                                Mario Party Superstars dips back into the series twenty-plus year history to deliver an entry that’s huge amounts of fun and sure to please long-time fans hungry for a more traditional Mario Party experience. Not only a warm nostalgic trip but the best party Mario has thrown in some time.                            
90	                                An outstanding celebration of the series’ legacy, coupled with well-implemented online features and gameplay tweaks. Mario Party Superstars is a thrilling roller coaster of emotions that has refined this formula to near perfection.                             
90	                                There's really nothing new in Mario Party Superstars, but what is here is pure nostalgia and the perfect entry for any player new to the series.                            
90	                                Mario Party Superstars won't change anyone's mind, but for those of us who enjoy it, there ain't no party like a Mario Party-party.                            
88	                                A hilarious revival of N64 and GC board games and mini-games that proves Nintendo listened to the feedback received after the previous Switch release. Whether you play with friends and family, or via Online, you'll have a blast. Alone, against the AI, you'll have fun with the mini-games, but the board mechanics will bore you.                            
85	                                These might be remakes of older titles, but this is exactly what this franchise needed: A return to roots to show newer audiences what made the original ones so special. With some of the best boards and minigames, as well as great visuals and sounds, this is one of the best Mario Party games, and the best party game on Switch.                            
85	                                Mario Party Superstars is a clear example that you don’t have to repair something that is not broken. Its a trip back to the Nintendo 64 era and the early years of the GameCube, that is, the time when Mario Party was most relevant.                            
85	                                With Mario Party Superstars alongside Super Mario Party, the Nintendo Switch has two different but great series installments. While Superstars would benefit from more boards, it’s a charming nostalgia-laden trip with far-reaching multiplayer appeal for family and friends of all ages. It’s also replayable as ever, with online play, achievements, and unlockables.                            
85	                                Your thoughts on button-based controls aside, Mario Party Superstars is a great entry for party game veterans and newcomers alike. Its minigames are all great, its boards each offer something different, and there's nothing quite like going from being last in a match in the last few turns and then surging into the lead right at the end...Mario Party is back, and it's the perfect way to spend an evening with friends – although you may not talk to each other for a few days afterward.                            
85	                                Mario Party Superstars ultimately marks a great entry in the franchise, getting back to the basics and building off of the stabilizing force that Super Mario Party provided for the wayward series, while stripping away some other innovations that had found their way into the franchise over the last several entries. This is Mario Party as you remember it – whether that is a good or bad thing is up to you. For me, it’s a great thing – the chaotic board game is back in its full backstabbing glory, with arguably the best minigame roster in the series and full online play from day one. In looking to the past, Mario Party Superstars has taken a much-needed step forward for the series.                            
85	                                If you’re a longtime Mario Party fan, you will love Mario Party Super Stars. If you’ve never played a Mario Party, there’s no better time than now to get into it. By yourself, on the couch, or online with friends or strangers, every way to play is a blast and then some. Some menu things are a bit annoying and I wish there was were a couple more characters or stages or mini-games to unlock. But in all, Mario Party is back, baby.                            
85	                                Nintendo parties along with Mario Party Superstars. The game features a whole heap of content from other Mario Party games to bring us 100 minigames across five cool boards. It's unfortunate that there are only five with so many boards to choose from. The same goes for the characters in the game. However there is enough, you simply miss a few. Still, if you are looking for a party, online or offline, this is the game to go for.                            
85	                                Mario Party Superstars has been a fabulous journey full of nostalgia in which I have also discovered much of what I missed about the franchise after parting ways with it.                            
85	                                Mario Party Superstars attempts to find common ground with fans of the series. Between the strategic boards, the mountains of minigames on offer and online gameplay, there is more than enough content to keep any Mario Party fan occupied for 20+ hours. Older generations may say, ‘they don’t make them how they used to’ and, for Mario Party, that’s certainly been the case for several years. So, while it’s not a perfect (re)union, Superstars returns to form with the old, the borrowed and the new.                            
84	                                The perceived best-of series is the best Mario Party in recent years, but could have used a bigger scope.                            
81	                                With its very classic approach including five streamlined game boards from the N64 era and healthy collection of 100 mini-games Mario Party Superstarts is an enjoyment especially for veterans of the series. As always, the best way to play the game is with others on the couch or online. But because of the a little better balanced AI solo players can have some more fun as in the predecessor Super Mario Party.                            
80	                                Mario Party Superstars is the strongest outing for the long-running franchise since at least the early GameCube days. It doesn't take many risks and admittedly lacks imagination, but this party leans on nostalgia and understands why these games are so popular among longtime fans. It's a well-executed and highly enjoyable return to the series' roots while remaining largely accessible to first-time players.                            
80	                                Featuring a gorgeous visual environment and sharp, well structuredgameplay experience, Mario Party Superstars is certain to bring afantastic time to players, whether solo or accompanied.                            
80	                                Mario Party Superstars comes to fill in the shoes of its mediocre predecessor by relying on successful mini-games throughout the series and gameplay mechanics that are tailored to suit players out and about. A beautiful recreation of classic game boards and a vast collection of classic mini-games, up to Mario Party 10, succeed in reminding us why the series has been a regular in Nintendo’s home consoles.                             
80	                                Mario Party Superstars is the greatest hits reunion tour of some of the best parts of Mario Party history, and it does a fantastic job of bringing the magic and wonder of classic boards and minigames into your living room. Still, it's hard to shake the feeling that Superstars could have been — and could still be — something more. It's right on the verge of becoming the definitive Mario Party experience, and everything it does, it does right. If you're content with the content on offer already, you'd be hard-pressed to find a better party game than this, either on the Switch or on any other platform.                            
80	                                While Mario Party Superstars doesn’t necessarily break massively new ground, it’s so good at replaying the classics that it will probably be my new go-to for Mario Party fun moving forward. It isn’t just the Nintendo 64 nostalgia talking here; this is a good collection of minigames, a smart board selection, a nice-looking game, and it’s got tons of settings, dials, and options to fiddle with for repeat play sessions. It might not be filled with new ideas, but Mario Party Superstars plays the hits, and plays them as well as it did the first time around.                            
80	                                As is the case with almost every Mario Party game, be aware of what you're getting into with Superstars. If you're not careful, friendships will take a hit, just because of the random nature of this beast. That's just Mario Party.                            
80	                                While I would have liked to have seen a couple more boards, the amount on offer here is quite substantial in all other regards. Just keep in mind that this is indeed a throwback, so those looking for a more novel take on Mario Party will probably want to look into Super Mario Party instead.                            
80	                                Mario Party Superstars brings back the best boards of the first games and the best mini-games of the franchise, updating them with all the mechanics we’ve come to know and love over the course of 23 years. Although it only has 5 boards and a lineup of 10 playable characters, it does a lot right on those boards and with those characters, so it’s hard to complain too much. It’s no cakewalk to rebalance old classics into something fresh and fun, but the team at Nintendo managed to do it. If you’re looking for the best party on the switch, be sure to grab Mario Party Superstars.                            
80	                                Mario Party Superstars is a great episode, so respectful of the past that it's not afraid to pay homage to it by improving the basic formula, while adding a much-needed feature like online play.                            
80	                                By offering a remake of older entries, Mario Party Superstars has given long-terms fans what they've wanted for a long time. If you weren't sold on the series previously, Superstars won't change your mind, but with three other friends, Superstars is some of the best multiplayer action going on Switch.                             
80	                                Mario Party Superstars is a worthy compilation of all of the series’ greatest hits. It has a great selection of minigames with plenty of different ways to enjoy them. The core board game works well for the most part, albeit somewhat hampered by Nintendo’s online infrastructure and some imbalanced design decisions. Online itself is functional enough, but expect to experience lag and the occasional dropped player. Rounding out the whole experience are the various unlockables on offer; all of which enhance the player experience in some way and give fans reasons to keep playing beyond just enjoying the occasional round with their friends. Indeed, Superstars is every bit the game Mario Party fans were hoping it would be, even if it does suffer from minor issues.                            
80	                                Mario Party Superstars is a blast from the past put into a very clean and modern package. It’ll definitely be more appealing to older generations of gamers who grew up before the early 2000s. The minigames and maps have aged well and showcase moments that truly defined the Mario Party franchise more than 20 years later.                            
80	                                Old and new players will enjoy this new Mario Party on Nintendo Switch. With its graphical improvements and its back to basics, this Superstars version finally offers a strong gameplay on the home console. The big positive point is of course the presence of online from the start of the adventure and for all game modes, but also the stickers allowing you to communicate with other players. More lively than ever, Mario Party Superstars may not be the best of the series, but allows you to forget the disappointment of 2018.                            
80	                                Mario Party Superstars contains tons of super-fun mini-games and a handful of beautifully recreated classic boards from the N64 era. You really can't go wrong with that so grab a few friends and party on, chums!                            
80	                                Mario Party Superstars offers a selection of completely revamped boards from the earliest days of the franchise. It might not offer much new, or change much, but it looks and feels as wild as fun as you remember.                            
80	                                Remakes of old N64 Mario Party boards may not sound the most desirable release of the season but in terms of easily accessible party games there are few better options.                            
80	                                If Super Mario Party chose to embark on the path of timid "next-gen" evolution, Mario Party Superstars takes the opposite, yet complementary, path of amarcord traditionalism. The result is a celebratory episode of exquisite workmanship, a reasoned selection of some of the most representative tables and minigames of what the franchise has been in its abundant twenty years of existence. Old, solid substance that is reborn with a completely new aspect, whose charm does not lie only in the aesthetics; among the details of a gameplay that is finally customizable and unprecedented opportunities for the multiplayer experience, Superstars is, even from a formal point of view, one of the most interesting and welcoming Mario Parties ever. A party of Mario who, remembering his own story, knows exactly how to be remembered.                             
80	                                This is a great party game, playable with every pad and controller, with one or more consoles. If you want a title to play in multiplayer, especially with “casual gamers”, this might be a great choice: better than Super Mario Party, maybe.                            
80	                                Mario Party Superstars is a nice "best of" with the best minigames of the franchise and revamped boards from the past.                            
80	                                Mario Party Superstars, with all its limitations, remains an unshakable institution. Revamping the pace of the boards a bit, however, is certainly Nintendo's next priority.                            
80	                                There's no doubt that Mario Party Superstars was a hasty project, pulled together to capitalise on the party season and keep the run-rate ticking over for Nintendo with a new release. It's hard not to look at a selection of boards that accounts for just a quarter of what was present in the first three Mario Party titles and not think that this is less a "superstars" package but rather a rather cynical sampler. Still, what is there is excellent quality, and if you've got Christmas parties and family events on the horizon then you will likely get a lot of value out of this game. Just don't spill beer on your controller. They don't make 'em as tough as they were back on the N64.                            
80	                                Mario Party Superstars is an amalgamation of some of the best boards, minigames, mechanics, and quality of life improvements from the whole series, resulting in the best Mario Party has been in a very long time.                            
80	                                Mario Party Superstars is the best game in the series, bringing a better selection of minigames and fewer gameplay gimmicks.                            
80	                                Mario Party Superstars is either a delightful stroll down memory lane or a great way to experience these games for the first time. No matter your history, it's a worthwhile celebration of the Mario Party franchise.                            
80	                                Mario Party Superstars returns to basics to deliver the best iteration in years. By returning to the golden era of boards and leaning upon an accomplished roster of proven minigames, it can focus on what has already made Mario Party great.                            
80	                                After a decade of games that sought to reinvent and renew the series, Mario Party Superstars rewinds time for a reminder of what made Mario Party popular in the first place. Five gorgeously recreated boards, 100 cherry-picked minigames, and countless opportunities to plan and scheme your way to victory... so long as the dice roll in your favour.                            
80	                                Mario Party Superstars is the best game in the series I’ve played. The abundance of minigames is excellent, and having them all available immediately is ideal. The unlockable items are fun to unlock, with plenty of customisable options for your in-game emotes. While it may seem like an easy game, there’s still plenty of fierce multiplayer duels to be fought within, so fans of the classic Mario Party experience are in luck here. However, if you steal stars then you deserve everything you get.                            
80	                                Mario Party Superstars is a love letter to the parties you remember attending 20 years ago. A disappointingly slim selection of boards takes the shine off things somewhat, but it’s hard to argue that this is the best Mario Party has been in over a decade. No new ideas absolutely feels like a missed opportunity, but by the same token we’d much prefer to have all these classic ideas intact rather than potentially tainting them with unwanted and unnecessary inclusions only added for the sake of being new. Grab a can of Tango and a fistful of 10p Freddos — you’re going to party like it’s 1999.                            
80	                                Fans new and old will definitely find joy in this nostalgic remake, so die-hard players just need to keep their expectations in line. Mario Party Superstars is a fun game like those before it, and its nostalgic flair is endearing enough to cover its flaws.                            
80	                                Mario Party Superstars somehow manages to entertain and impress while bringing almost nothing new to the table aside from some annoying stickers and appreciated save features. Nintendo knows the road to success is nostalgia, and they manage to use it to hit the mark every time.                            
77	                                Mario Party Superstars manages to be one of the most entertaining party games by bringing together the most entertaining parts of the old games of the series and providing seamless online support.                            
75	                                This new Mario Party is more of a best of compilation than a new iteration. The players will split into two groups : those who will have a feeling of déjà-vu, and those who will appreciate the nostalgic effect. On the other hand, there is no doubt that for newbies, Mario Party Superstars is really a great first experience with the Mario Party formula.                            
75	                                Superstars is fantastic party game where you and your friends can have a great time with a solid selection of classic minigames.                            
75	                                Quotation forthcoming.                            
75	                                If you want a game to warm up your winter, Mario Party Superstars is for you! The compilation, intended to punctuate your family reunions, will seduce you in a snap by bringing back wonderful memories, at least if you have played past episodes. The whole benefits in addition to accessible and fun mini-games and a very successful visual coating. However, let us note all the same that Mario Party Superstars lacks content and shares too much in common with its elder. If you've done The Top 100 recently, you'll be on familiar ground.                             
75	                                Mario Party Superstars offers a great package of classic boards and minigames that looks and plays great, but it's also a little too safe and comes with some annoying structural decisions.                            
75	                                Mario Party Superstars is a fun, nostalgic ride and will provides hours of fun among groups of friends. However, it's hard not to look at what else could be added when there's such a rich pool of content to pull from, and most other games have launched with more on offer.                            
75	                                Mario Party Superstars is a safe but true love-letter to the franchises greatest moments. It doesn’t reinvent itself in any way, but it’s absolutely a good time for all                            
72	                                Mario Party Superstars won't offer fans from the 20-year-old franchise anything new and making matters worse: there are important mini-games that were neglected. Only 100 mini-games are not enough, especially when Nintendo had already done this four years ago on the 3DS. However, thanks to its replay value and nostalgia, this game is worth it if you play with friends a lot, but as it happens with this kind of games, you probably won't be friends anymore once the match is over.                            
70	                                Quotation forthcoming.                            
70	                                Mario Party Superstars do exactly what it should — it's a great party game for those who wants to spend some fun times with family or friends.                            
70	                                60 euros is a steep price for this much content. Beyond that, this stingy game actually is Mario Party at its best, for anyone wanting to reconnect, or discover, the real chaos it's meant to be.                            
70	                                Should you be looking for a "Best of" collection of Mario Party goodness, Superstars should be your go-to. Though its flaws are pretty apparent, those keen on rose-tinted perceptions will find a lot to like with the newest iteration. Even those simply in need of some fun with a group of friends will have a good time with what's on offer, so long as it's local multiplayer and not online. It's a nice callback to the brighter days of the franchise, complete with a lot of trinkets from the past. May not be kind to solo players, however.                            
70	                                The lack of worthwhile unlockable content is one of the biggest downsides in Mario Party Superstars, but those who are only interested in using it as a party game likely won't be all that disappointed. Mario Party Superstars has fun online multiplayer functionality and makes a number of important quality of life improvements when compared to its predecessor, and so it's still a big step in the right direction for the franchise, despite some of its shortcomings.                            
70	                                Mario Party Superstars is an enjoyable package of some of the very best mini games in the series’ history. Like with most Mario Party games, it’s best played with a group of friends as the CPU simply isn’t that fun to play with, and relies too much on randomness in order for it to be hugely enjoyable when playing against strangers online. You could make the case that Superstars feels like a backwards step for the Mario Party series with the limited number of boards, lack of character-specific features and omission of motion-control mini games, but it’s still a hugely enjoyable experience when playing in a large group with friends and family.                             
70	                                Mario Party Superstars reworks much of the content that helped shape the series, which has more than 15 iterations, introducing features long requested by fans, such as online mode and the ability to play in portable mode. These decisions formulate a game with countless details to enjoy, but which limits it by trying to appeal to everyone. Still this is an essential title for all those looking for a Party Game for family and friends gatherings, compiling some of the best and funniest minigames ever in the series.                            
70	                                Mario Party Superstars is an excellent package for long-suffering Mario Party fans, but it's almost certainly not going to lead to any new converts. Online multiplayer is a nice feature to have at launch, and the variety of 100 minigames will keep things feeling fresh for your first dozen hours of play at least. But with that said, this is quite literally the safest Mario Party entry imaginable, and even with a hot nostalgia injection, I think I prefer Super Mario Party as the Switch's premier place to ruin your relationships.                             
70	                                All in all, Mario Party Superstars is a good remake of some incredibly fantastic classic games. It looks great and plays just like the Mario Party games of years past. Sadly, it falls short of being a must-have for all Switch owners outside of Mario Party fans thanks to its relatively small and stagnant roster and board selection. But in the end, the wonderful gameplay is the biggest redeeming factor that makes Mario Party Superstars an enjoyable experience.                            
70	                                Mario Party Superstars is exactly what you'd expect: it's a nostalgia-fest that brings back some of the most beloved boards and minigames from past titles and touches them up for the Nintendo Switch. Each game board has been delightfully updated, and the nostalgic minigame selection is generally pretty good. But beyond that nostalgia factor, Superstars hasn't added anything new to the series. The minigame modes aren't very exciting, and the visuals, while nice, aren't different from any other Mario game from the past few years. It's definitely a great way to experience those classic N64 boards, as long as you don't expect anything more.                            
70	                                Superstars fills a weird niche for Mario Party fans. If you're missing the old maps, this is a great way to dredge them up without suffering through the ancient visuals. Conversely, if you're looking for more modern Mario Party action, this entry will fall a bit short of your expectations. Little things have been rolled back, little problems persist. That game where you rip open your palm to win at tug-of-war is back, for example. The game looks modern, but feels more like a classic entry in the franchise. If the thing you were missing was frustration and elation in equal measure, then yours will be a rich bounty indeed. For better and for worse, this is a heaping helping of the cruel whimsy you remember so well. Mario Party Superstars is a glamorous trip down cherished paths you've mostly blocked from your memory.                            
70	                                Mario Party Superstars takes some of the best boards from the Nintendo 64 very first chapters, alongside 100 of the best mini-games coming also from the Gamecube era, bringing them all together in a new game for Nintendo Switch. This game is not a collection, nor a remastered. It is more a best of, updated with today’s graphics and new online games modes. There are some downsides though, like only five boards and the lack of content for solo players, but if you have a bunch of friends or a family full of children, Mario Party Superstars will reward you with a lot of fun moments with the joy of sociality.                            
60	                                This might be the best of Mario Party, completely open online, yet Superstars also highlight the formula's inherent flaws due to a lack of boards, some lingering random elements despite the additional parameters, and the absence of creativity, if not ambition overall.                             
60	                                If you grew up with Mario Party in the noughties and you mainly want to wallow in nostalgia, Superstars is the way to go. But if you don't have it yet, you better get Super Mario Party to meet your Party needs.                             
60	                                Mario Party Superstars may bring back fond memories of Nintendo's mini-game franchise, but being from the past doesn’t automatically make it a blast.                            
60	                                Mario Party Superstars certainly provides the highs that the series is capable of, but unless you're restricted to playing on the Switch Lite or itching to play with a Pro Controller, there's a better version of this game available for you and your loved ones to play in Super Mario Party.                            
100	                                It is a devilish delight to navigate Dusk’s hellish environments and labyrinth-like levels, all whilst laying waste to its army of twisted enemies with its second to none gunplay. Not only is this title a fitting tribute to the games that inspired it, but it’s also something that manages to feel entirely relevant to the modern era due to its impeccable gameplay and emphasis on providing a simple but intriguing story. So if you are in any way nostalgic for retro FPS experiences, or for that matter, just a lover of FPS games in general, then do yourself a favor and check out Dusk on the Switch.                            
90	                                DUSK is a bloody good time on Switch that perfectly evokes the spirit of the best 90’s shooters.                            
90	                                Dusk is the kind of game I could not help but smile while I was playing it. Every level was a treat to play and the accessibility options really open it up to so many people. The attention to detail in this port is also super appreciated. It really takes advantage of the hardware while not compromising the original concept. This is a game that every fan of shooters needs to play, and I cannot recommend it enough.                             
90	                                DUSK is an amazingly authentic ode to the old kings of the genre, and it’s as fiendishly fun as it is filled with carnage. This Switch port is virtually flawless, allowing you to enjoy this game in a pure, uncompromised form. I’m always skeptical of recommendations about this sort of game, as I often find they don’t quite measure up in one way or another. DUSK? It had me from hello and kept me all the way through to the bitter end. Then I started it up all over again just to have another ride on this ridiculous roller coaster.                            
90	                                Dusk is one hell of an impressive piece of software and possibly the single best Unity port to Switch we've ever seen, sidestepping all the usual performance problems and delivering a brilliant experience of a brilliant game. We've tried to think of meaningful criticisms or negatives. Of course pad controls are never going to be as precise as mouse aim, but when the developers have tailored the analogue sticks to such a degree of precision, that would be churlish to ding them for. It's not as good a game as Quake, but almost nothing is. It's arguably a better port than Quake got, and that was itself excellent. There's a relatively limited arsenal of weapons — they're all great, but there's no iconic gun here, just your usual pistol, shotty, assault rifle, explosives, et al. Ultimately, Dusk is another absolute cracker in what's turned out to be a phenomenal month for Switch; a real horror show, and the highest of 9s.                            
90	                                DUSK’s arrival on Switch has been a long time coming. But I'm honestly relieved that the creator took his time sanding down and sharpening every little corner of DUSK for its Switch debut. It feels like a game that was meant to be played on Nintendo’s console and uses its retro inspirations to pump new life into this particular genre of games. If you ask me, it's the beginning of a new dawn.                            
85	                                Dusk is a fast-paced, fun retro FPS. Its weapons and enemies are well thought-out, and its gameplay shines above its muddy colors and occasional monotonous levels.                            
85	                                When this game came out in 2018, I missed it entirely. Don't an ignorant fool like I was, and don't miss the opportunity to play Dusk. It a fantastic retro horror shooter that will delight you long after Halloween is over. The Switch port is amazing as well.                            
85	                                DUSK has found a fantastic home on the Switch, where its top-tier throwback FPS can bloom in all its bloody, wretched glory.                            
85	                                We promise: if you accept the "retro" graphic style which can inevitably divide, Dusk is probably the best FPS of the Nintendo Switch.                             
100	                                The rough edges mean Switch isn't the ideal platform to play Disco Elysium on, but it's still a perfectly fine choice, and the ability to play such a phenomenal game on the go is a welcome option. You still get the full Final Cut treatment here--including full voice acting, which is impressive given the game's storage requirements have been shrunk even further on Switch--and despite the shortcomings, Disco Elysium instantly joins the ranks of the best games on Switch.                            
95	                                Disco Elysium on Switch manages to keep the enjoyment of the original game intact, with excellent readability of text and interface, even in portable mode. The grip on the controller is also well thought out and no point of friction taints the experience. The only downsides: a stable framerate, but which will struggle to exceed 30 FPS and long loading times between each zone. But if not, if you like (very good) reading and universes as original as they are dense, you can go for it: you will surely live one of your best role-playing experiences.                             
92	                                Disco Elysium remains a narrative masterpiece and one of the best RPG experiences around. The Switch version is not the most technically astounding around, but it's clearly well made and solid enough to offer the original experience in all its glory to any player.                            
91	                                Disco Elysium remains an incredible RPG on Switch, and plays perfectly on this portable console. If you haven't tried it yet, now is the best time to do so and on the go.                             
90	                                There will be essays written on Disco Elysium. This is one of those games that will be studied in universities as Citizen Kane is studied in film and D. H. Lawrence's work is all-but unavoidable if you study literature. It's not necessarily the most outright entertaining thing the medium has ever produced, but it's an important work that explores the boundaries and potential of video games, while also having the nuance and layers it needs to challenge players to think beyond the joy they get from pressing buttons. Even if you have to play the Switch port, as inferior as it is, you should make sure that you play Disco Elysium on something.                             
90	                                Those that have been waiting to try Disco Elysium have no reason to hold out any longer. The game is available on pretty much every platform out there now, and it’s well worth playing. It’s unlike just about anything else, and it begs the question of what developer ZA/UM will manage to craft next.                            
90	                                Disco Elysium: The Final Cut is an absolute triumph. The narrative and dialogue, which is already wonderfully compelling on its own, has been given a massive boost thanks to the excellent voice acting introduced for the Final Cut. The gameplay features a host of branching paths for you to explore, and while the slow, methodical approach may turn a few people off, this is nevertheless one of the most well-told stories in any medium from the last few years. The performance issues at the time of writing slightly took the shine off things — and we hope they're ironed out soon via updates — but even with them present, Disco Elysium: The Final Cut stands as one of the best RPGs available on Switch.                            
85	                                Quotation forthcoming.                            
80	                                With a fascinating, grisly, and grimy world to explore, Disco Elysium offers an engrossing world and captivating characters in every moment of gameplay. Unveiling that story and interrogating citizens is an unforgettable adventure, but it’s sadly held back significantly by long load times and performance issues.                            
80	                                If you can’t play it elsewhere, Disco Elysium: The Final Cut on Nintendo Switch is a great option, especially if it’s your first time playing. Returning Revacholians will find the long loading times to be an extra annoyance, but it’s not like we didn’t put up with worse when the PS5 version launched. There’s just nothing quite like Disco Elysium.                            
80	                                Technical issues currently hamper a truly individual gaming experience. The well-written and deeply detailed world, characters and story will absorb you into this film noir, while the dopamine hit of RNG will keep you anchored in a reality you both do and do not find yourself in.                            
80	                                Barring the performance and crashing issues, Disco Elysium – The Final Cut has been adapted to the Switch really well with smart compromises and great tweaks to the interface and controls. My concerns about the UI and text were all put to rest after I launched it and played for an hour. If the technical issues can be addressed, this will be my favorite version of the game by far. It also has me very optimistic about a potential iPad port which likely wouldn’t have these issues.                            
80	                                The constant ebb and flow of Disco Elysium's storyline makes for one amazing adventure that can easily be replayed, tackling problems in different ways each time. The Nintendo Switch is a great fit for this kind of game, and the adjustment of the controls was handled well by the team at ZA/UM. This is a perfect rendition of Disco Elysium for new players who are interested in the game, or returning players who want to relive the fever dream on a portable console.                            
80	                                Overall, Disco Elysium is one of those games I feel like we’re still going to be talking about ten years from now. Technical issues aside, the writing and worldbuilding present in this game lift it high above a lot of the other entries in the genre. This is further helped by the fantastic voice acting and narration that was also recently added to all other versions of the game. The voice that narrates everything and also plays your different stats is really satisfying to listen to, keeping me around to hear it all even though I could personally read way faster than he could talk. If you enjoy games that lean heavily into their dice rolling foundations, you should absolutely put your time into Disco Elysium; you will not regret it. With its myriad of technical difficulties on the Switch, however, it may be a good idea to look elsewhere unless portability is your main concern.                            
65	                                While a terrific game in it’s own right, Disco Elysium: The Final Cut just doesn’t cut it on Nintendo Switch. Lengthy loading times between small rooms and different floors of buildings makes the game drag enough to completely lose the narrative flow, which is a big problem considering narrative is its primary focus.  If load times get fixed alongside the poor A.I. that tends to get your character lost while trying to look at something two feet in front of them, you got a great portable game. Until then, it’s all some what of a bummer.                            
93	                                Yet another masterpiece by Kan Gao, probably the most solid and balanced overall. The story of Quincy and Lynri passes through regrets, remorse, fears and IF. Gao's writing is always impeccable and is capable of never falling into the banal, even when it touches themes already abused in the medium and in narration in general. So far my very personal best game of the year.                            
91	                                Writing a review for games like this feels bizarre to me, because synthesizing the work down to a number honestly feels wrong. It’s akin to going into an art gallery and scoring each painting or sculpture, and while that seems like I’m laying the praise on a bit thick, I genuinely feel this way. Whenever I’ve been in a slump or felt lost, a good book or movie with something to say has always been the best prescription. Impostor Factory can be that antidote for those who need it. Thank you, Kan, and thank you, Freebird Games. You’ve created an outstanding trilogy, and I absolutely, unequivocally, cannot wait to see what you do next. You have a supporter for life.                            
81	                                It’s really unfair assign a mark to this game. It’s unfair not because it’s a bad game, but because it’s complex and almost disrespectful to crush this work into a sterile number. A videogame that is also a “non-videogame”, and it knowingly turns this flaw into strength, telling us a love story that turns into a reflection upon reality and the nature of choosing, surrounding it with a beautiful painting done with pixels.                            
80	                                This is Freebird's best work, a narrative driven game emotionally packed, but also full of humor and great characters.                            
80	                                Quotation forthcoming.                            
80	                                Impostor Factory is a surprisingly beautiful game that questions what it means to have a meaningful life. It tells a cyclical narrative that still manages to feel honest and emotionally raw. It works best if you go into it with as little information as possible, so I won’t say much more than that on how the story unfolds. It is a bit predictable and slow moving. Still it tells incredibly competent story that surprised me with how evocative it was. In the end, the bits of sc-fi and the explanation of an AI-driven time loop were the perfect additions to a game so deeply entrenched in human emotion. Impostor Factory knows what it’s about and delivers on that point.                            
80	                                Freebird games have always been funny in a gentle way that doesn’t clash with the games’ tender yet challenging emotional core. In Impostor Factory, the team has taken a big swing by including full-on horror, as well as a complex meta-story involving the nature of science and time itself. And the humor is both slapstick and risky, letting players release tension as they explore the gore and mind-bending moral conundrums posed by the game’s story. The boxing cat and the sentient rice cooker are a welcome bonus.                            
80	                                Impostor Factory clearly shows the growth of its author. The topics dealt with may not fit everyone's tastes, just as we definitely feel the void left by the sparkling interactions between the two protagonists of the previous chapters; however, Kan Gao seems to have clear ideas about the direction his saga is taking, as well as an increasingly refined talent for causing emotional devastation to the players.                            
80	                                Impostor Factory doesn't punch emotionally like To The Moon and Finding Paradise, but Kan Gao's and Freebird Games' skills are still intact.                            
80	                                Impostor Factory offers yet another tear-jerking, emotional roller coaster with murder mystery flair. The very definition of bittersweet, Impostor Factory’s emotional climax will only make sense to those familiar with the series, so if this is your first foray into the franchise, please grab To The Moon and Finding Paradise first before diving into this sentimental adventure. Where To the Moon sought fantasy from reality and Finding Paradise sought reality from fantasy, Impostor Factory blends them together in a beautifully unexpected way, reminding us to live life while we have it. If you want a wonderfully well-written story with fully fleshed out characters and thoughtfully choreographed scenes that feel charmingly cinematic, please play Impostor Factory (after To The Moon and Finding Paradise, of course!).                            
80	                                Impostor Factory teases and deceives, involves and strangles. It doesn't have the destabilizing power of To The Moon, nor the brain balance of Finding Paradise, but that's okay.                             
67	                                On its own, Impostor Factory is a decent adventure with occasionally interesting story elements and mostly enjoyable dialogue. But as part of the otherwise great series, it's a disappointing misstep.                            
95	                                This title is full of new ideas, design that is coherent with its larger ideas and it offers an attempt to draw attention to real-life subjects such as social diversity, just like a true work of art. Taken in total, The Eternal Cylinder is an unforgettable experience.                            
95	                                The Eternal Cylinder is a gorgeous adventure game that features one of the most compelling stories I've seen in years. Its strict linearity may be frustrating for some, but that slight downside is vastly outweighed by this game's many strengths.                            
90	                                The Eternal Cylinder has a cool story, interesting exploration mechanics, a good unique idea in the mutations, and solid presentation. While it starts off a little slow, once it gets going it kept me engaged and pushing forward. The trebhums might be too cute for their own good but it’s nice to see how they solve puzzles via mutations while navigating their cylinder threatened planet.ACE Team has specialized in weird worlds, but this is the first time the studio has managed to craft one that is also beautiful and immersive. Sometimes I wanted the gameplay spaces to be a little bigger, or even entirely open world. But I understand that The Eternal Cylinder needs structure and hope that the easy-to-understand mechanics and cute protagonists will allow a wide range of players to engage with the game.                            
90	                                The world of The Eternal Cylinder is the most imaginative surrealist representation I’ve seen to date. You’ll be shaking your head in wonder at just how the hell anyone was able to think up such a design for a creature that just skids across the water. Or the giant floating monsters that want to sit on you. It’s a boon that the gameplay holds up as well and if you ever find it too challenging, it’s easy to turn down various settings to let you sit back and immerse yourself in something you won’t be able to easily describe to your friends. And the longer you play you’ll wonder why more games aren’t this creative in all aspects. I really enjoyed my time guiding my flock of Trebhum from danger to salvation. And I hope you will too. Just remember to roll like you didn’t know you could.                            
80	                                For all the team’s expertise on the weird, the fact that this visual identity is far from the intended appeal should give you an idea at just how well the mechanics and overall reaction to such interlocking systems plays out. Most of which left to the player’s own imagination with how best to utilize said tools and similarly-spoken scenarios. But not for a second do ACE Team view an otherwise absence of comprehension as an automatic fail-state. Yet at the same time, managing to burrow enough of a temptation that failure in that regard will almost always be by the player’s own curious, sometimes greedy, hand. That level of confidence but more so lenience in its concept — an understanding on when and how survival mechanics can be implemented without feeling tedious or invasive — in the end is what makes The Eternal Cylinder as fascinating an adventure to decipher as it is to watch unfold with bated breath.                            
70	                                This chase-and-reprieve dynamic makes for a well-paced campaign which should take most players 12 hours or so to complete. The Eternal Cylinder makes for a tricky game to conveniently classify, and the mix of survival, exploration, platforming, puzzle, and action elements does sometimes collide with its clumsy and slippery controls. Adjustable difficulty settings are welcoming, but even on default mode there’s a generosity of checkpointing and saves, and rarely is an attempt punished too harshly; plus, when the permanent mutation system is later unlocked, it feels practically game-breaking. Warts and all, The Eternal Cylinder remains an accessible oddball adventure of one-of-a-kind sights.                            
70	                                A winning but wayward chimera of survival game, surrealism and storybook adventure.                            
90	                                Mobius Digital has once again proven that they are masters of their craft. Echoes of the Eye carries on the legacy of Outer Wilds by delivering a riveting narrative told in a beautiful new world, paired with an excellent use of the main game's mechanics to deliver its story. While some parts of the DLC are frustrating in their implentation of horror elements, the option to make these parts easier, as well as the other parts of the game, make them worth going through.                            
90	                                Everything you wanted from an Outer Wilds DLC in a package you never thought to expect. Echoes of the Eye puts its own twists on the base game’s formula without a single misstep.                            
90	                                Quotation forthcoming.                            
81	                                While I still enjoyed my time with Echoes overall, I’m a bit disappointed by the approach to wholly abandon the scope of the original and lock players into one area. I also did not enjoy the spooky area as it forces a different playstyle of focusing on how far you can go before you reset. I no longer felt like an intrepid explorer and more like a speedrunner, hoping I could key up a sequence, sneak by, and just get ten feet further than I did last time. In the end, the story changes, and parts of the new area are a delight to see. Some of the new mechanics like the rafting or manipulation of light are most welcome. So while Echoes gives up parts of what made Outer Wilds so great in the grand exploration, Echoes of the Eye is a solid companion piece to the base game. I just wish I didn’t spend nearly all of it away from my spaceship.                            
80	                                That's what makes Echoes of the Eye unmissable if you couldn't get enough of Outer Wilds. It manages to push you in new, challenging directions with puzzles that scratch the same part of your brain that the original did while not relying on the same tricks. It's a feat that shows the depth of design prowess Mobius Digital first flexed in its debut title, but stumbles slightly when it tries to redefine its means of progression in the final third. These are the weakest moments in all Outer Wilds, but they aren't enough to sully what this fantastic expansion adds to an adventure that still stands as captivating and engrossing.                            
80	                                Despite a few flaws, Echoes of the Eye brilliantly replicates what made the magic of Outer Wilds, with a new area that is both puzzling and awe-inspiring, both sumptuous and mysterious. It's simple, the first few hours of the adventure are absolutely thrilling, when the player slowly takes ownership of the workings and secrets of an environment that seems to be there from the start. An excellent start, however, a little spoiled by new horror-oriented phases, where you will pace in the dark if you do not have the right information, at the risk of being spotted by frightening creatures and having to go back and forth. frustrating returns to try your luck again. As usual, you may also be frustrated if a crucial clue passes you by, Echoes of the Eye calling more than ever to be an observer. Otherwise, it's a complete success. A goodbye worthy of the name to the great Outer Wilds.                             
80	                                Echoes of the Eye is a wonderful return to the clockwork solar system of Outer Wilds, even if its occasional horror game sections aren’t quite as interesting as what came before.                            
100	                                Kena: Bridge of Spirits should take most gamers around 10 to 12 hours to complete, depending on the amount of exploring and the level of difficulty. While the blockbusters games of 2021 continue to deliver the same ho-hum experience of 2021, Kena is a much needed ray of sunshine to the current choices of titles available and more importantly, looks fantastic on the PlayStation 5.                            
100	                                Amazing graphics is one thing, but Bridge of Spirits is so much more thanks to engaging level design and surprisingly deep combat. It's a game that overdelivers on almost all fronts, making for a truly superb and memorable adventure.                            
100	                                With its Pixar-like characters and beyond stunning animation, Kena: Bridge of Spirits is as charming as it is dark with plenty of surprises that will not only keep players enthralled for hours but also captivate their hearts.                            
100	                                Every single moment of Kena: Bridge of Spirits is simply wonderful. Very few games are as pleasing to the eyes, and coming from an indie studio – making its very first game, of all things – that's something quite remarkable. Even more remarkable is that Kena isn't simply a visual showcase, either. It's challenging, fun to play, and has a world teeming with life. It also tells a fantastic story, and there's plenty to do even when the credits have rolled. Kena: Bridge of Spirits truly is something special, and I can't wait to see what Ember Lab does next.                            
95	                                Kena: Bridge of Spirits is a remarkable and magical adventure, and it’s honestly still hard to believe this is an indie title. This is the kind of game that simply needs to be part of every gamer’s library and one that raises the bar for the adventure genre in this generation. With emotional story beats, a compelling game world, engaging level design, challenging boss battles, and surprising combat versatility, Kena: Bridge of Spirits is an experience far greater than the sum of its many interconnected parts.                            
95	                                I’m not sure how Ember Lab did it, but I walked away from Kena: Bridge of Spirits with my expectations surpassed to a much further extent than I could have imagined. The visuals are breathtaking, the gameplay evolves in meaningful ways, and the heart the story contains has no bounds. You’ll find it hard to come across a more wholesome and beautiful game in 2021 than Kena: Bridge of Spirits, it’s everything I wanted it to be and more.                            
91	                                Kena: Bridge Of Spirits might draw upon some aged influences, but the way it assembles the various pieces of the puzzle together makes it feel very modern indeed.                            
91	                                After playing a couple of great AAA 3D platformers earlier this year, I'm absolutely blown away that I enjoyed Kena: Bridge of Spirits even more. With thoroughly challenging fast-paced combat, rewarding puzzles, and a breathtaking world; it's one phenomenal game.                            
90	                                A stunningly beautiful 3D action-adventure that combines environmental puzzles, exploration and Dark Souls-like (both in implementation and challenge) combat.                            
90	                                Kena: Bridge of Spirits is a fantastic adventure, one which does an incredible job of mixing platforming elements, fun and energetic combat, a rewarding exploration system and beautiful graphics. It's not only of the best games of 2021, it's one of the best games in recent years.                             
90	                                Kena Bridge of Spirits is a magical adventure, even if it doesn't do anything entirely original. Its elements tie together well, and it's jaw-droppingly gorgeous on PS5. It hearkens back to the days of PS2 platformers in all the best ways, and despite a few small issues, it stands out as one of 2021's best titles.                            
90	                                Kena: Bridge of Spirits is a magical journey, one that I hope everyone will take.                            
90	                                Kena might not be perfect, but it's far from what one might expect from a studio's first game. It's a spectacle to look at without being too long or too short, and it's one of the rare examples of a game that deserves a movie adaptation, not the other way around. Perhaps more than anything else, it's a game that sets the bar high for whatever Ember Lab wants to do next.                            
90	                                For its first attempt, Ember Lab makes quite simply a master stroke. By delivering an ideally successful action-adventure game on all fronts, the studio, however neophyte, is not content to "just" perfectly fulfill the specifications of an excellent production. Kena: Bridge of Spirits is a delicious breath of fresh air, which marvelously combines the grace of a sumptuous animated film and the game design intelligence of an ingenious video game, with multiple inspirations. As for Ember Lab, faced with so much mastery of their subject for a first production, it is advisable to take our hat off to them and already wait firmly for their next creation.                            
90	                                Kena: Bridge of Spirits is an excellent debut game from developer Ember Lab. Pulling from legendary franchises like Pikmin and God of War — with a splash of Ori and the Blind Forest for good measure — Kena manages to balance a compelling story with engaging gameplay and a charming art direction to create a worthwhile adventure.                            
90	                                The act of meeting and understanding all those other characters is powerful, though. Kena: Bridge of Spirits is ultimately a game about making those connections, just like it's about making a connection with the game world around you through the Rot. It centers on characters who tried valiantly but failed to help one another, and what dealing with that pain did to them. It's about exploring a world and seeing what it once was, and helping to restore it again. And while Kena: Bridge of Spirits is full of familiar-feeling combat and exploration, its ability to find different ways to look at those ideas makes for a beautiful, emotional, and exciting journey.                            
90	                                Kena: Bridge of Spirits is the finest adventure game released in years and a clear highlight of the latest console cycle. Both its exploration and combat components gradually build in complexity with tools that always have a clear purpose. That elegant mechanical design keeps the focus on the game’s impactful story, which tells an aching, but hopeful tale of environmental disaster. There are a lot of points of comparisons to be made when breaking it all down, but Kena: Bridge of Spirits blends every little influence together into its own gorgeous mix.                            
90	                                Bridge of Spirits stumbles a little in spots, yet confidently sprints into the heart of the adventure, rewarding the player with secrets galore and visuals that are almost always worth admiring. If you love Zelda-like games or are just looking for an experience that will make you smile every step of the way, you can’t go wrong with Kena: Bridge of Spirits.                            
90	                                Kena: Bridge of Spirits is absolutely brilliant. It's one of those rare games that feels like it belongs to the new generation thanks to its magnificent world, and its developers knew exactly how ambitious to be while still providing a top rate experience.                            
89	                                I found Kena: Bridge of Spirits to be one of the best treats of the year, both for the eyes and for the soul. Not only does it show elaborate craftsmanship, but it also feels like it was infused with joy and awareness. I'm happy it's here, and I look forward to seeing where Kena's bridge can lead.                            
88	                                Kena: Bridge of Spirits is simply charming. A game where everything is in the right place and that can be surprisingly challenging when it wants. As a debut title, Ember Labs did a great job.                            
88	                                After completing Kena, we felt the desire not to leave these virtual lands, to continue further into the heart of the forest to eliminate even the last bit of Corruption. Like the souls of the village, in short, we didn't want to "go further" either. The magic of Bridge of Spirits is all here: in its sweet magnetism, in its balance between gameplay and storytelling, in the echo of those adventure games of yesteryear, where simplicity moved hand in hand with refinement. Gorgeous to look at and rewarding to play, Kena is a debut work that has rarely been seen in recent years: that the independent sector can be guided by its spirit.                             
87	                                Kena: Bridge of Spirits not only looks gorgeous, it additionally delights with challenging combat and simply enjoyable exploration.                            
86	                                "Satisfactory" is a well suited adjective for this game. It may not be as groundbreaking as other games in the genre, but it offers really interesting exploration and combats. And you'll love your Rots too.                            
85	                                Kena is beautiful, well balanced between combat, puzzle, and platforming, and has some surprisingly challenging bosses. It doesn't reinvent anything, but all that offers works well.                            
85	                                This adventure is an absolute joy to experience. It tells an emotional story, looks great and plays well, managing to feel simultaneously fresh and classic. Kena: Bridge of Spirits never reinvents the wheel, but it doesn’t need to. Definitely worth your time and money.                             
85	                                Kena: Bridge of Spirits is stunning spectacle full of heart and unbelievable charm. If you aren't carefully selecting hats for your Rot companions by the end, then you're probably made of stone. In the event that your soul is inhospitably frosty, Kena can be deceivingly challenging, throwing boss fights at you that will make those on Demon Souls look like a cake walk. A few minor issues stop Kena from being a showstopper, but there is no doubt that this a great game, and an amazing debut for a 15-person strong team.                            
85	                                It's a pity that Kena: Bridge of Spirits did not get a big marketing campaign because it definitely deserves recognition. It's a lovely, well-constructed game for everyone. I really hope we'll see more of Kena in the future, and I wish more debuts like this for every studio.                            
85	                                Kena: Bridge of Spirits is a beautiful game for sure, but it's not just a pretty face to look at: It has engaging gameplay mechanics, great bosses and story and an amazing soundtrack to boot. Ember Labs has delivered us an amazing game and a great addition to the PS5 library.                            
85	                                It’s pretty amazing to think that Kena: Bridge of Spirits is Ember Lab’s very first game. With absolutely stunning visuals and impactful music this is sure to leave an impression on people. Gameplay-wise it doesn’t do anything particularly new or innovative but that doesn’t stop it from being loads of fun. This is a small adventure with enough challenge and heart to keep you entertained for the full 10–15 hours that it’ll take for you to reach its conclusion.                            
85	                                Kena: Bridge of Spirits is an excellent debut. Even if the story ends a bit in the background, the beauty of the world, the animations and the combat system make the adventure of Kena and his friends Rot's truly memorable.                            
85	                                Kena: Bridge of Spirits is a fantastic adventure that relies on its beautiful art direction, combination of gameplay elements and its great level design to deliver a game that you should not miss.                            
83	                                Kena: Bridge of Spirits is an astonishing action-adventure with a unique art direction. It proposes brilliant puzzle-platform sections and let the player be free to explore and manage the pace with their own rhythm.                            
80	                                Kena: Bridge of Spirits has many strengths, but because of that all the flaws tend to stick out even stronger. The lack of polish makes this magical world feel a bit artificial. All that is great about it, truly is amazing. But when you grab the controller itself, you will feel every bump down this 10 hour long road.                            
80	                                Kena: Bridge of Spirits does little we haven't seen before. Regardless, the game sports small challenges in digestable environmental puzzles, that can be as wonderful as they can be frustrating.                            
80	                                A beautiful, pleasant adventure game, designed very well, if not very originally. This lack of invention, in addition to a story that’s just not too interesting, keeps Kena from truly shining, but it’s still well worth your time.                            
80	                                Kena fills the void left by a now-scarce genre that used to be far more common than it is today. It’s a simple story of love and loss with gorgeous visuals and a play loop ripped straight from the PS2 era. I would have liked a few more concessions to help players navigate the world and its challenges, but I still enjoyed my time here — it doesn’t reinvent the action-adventure platformer wheel, but it managed to put a nostalgic smile on my face.                            
80	                                Boss battles aside, Kena: Bridge of Spirits is a remarkable first effort from Ember Lab that showcases their amazing potential. They’ve crafted a beautiful world and touching story that really highlight the strength of their writing and animation capabilities, and the soundtrack is captivating. While Kena provides engaging activities as you explore, the inexperience with combat clearly shows. Kena serves as a strong foundation for Ember Lab to build upon, and it’s clear that given more experience they’re capable of great things to come.                            
80	                                You are constantly haunted by dozens of black ghosts. Your only task is to guide lost souls to the afterlife. Sounds like a scary horror game, doesn't it? But 'Kena: Bridge of spirits' is just the opposite: a beautifully cute yet challenging action-adventure game that is definitely worth a spot on your wish list.                            
80	                                Kena: Bridge of Spirits is the game that was missing to end 2021 in the best way possible. This title pictures a reality not far from ours, where the corruption is imminent and the salvation of the land demands a path that challenge us and makes us grow into a better version of ourselves. As a Spirit Guide, Kena took the compromise of freeing every soul that needed her. She felt fear, failed to have decisions but with the help of her Rot friends she was able to accomplish her mission, in which is the perfect balance between duty and passion.                            
80	                                Kena: Bridge of Spirits is a solid game that hearkens back to titles of the sixth generation of games, with a coat of paint indicative of modern gaming that should appease younger players while offering enough gameplay variety for anyone to enjoy.                            
80	                                I felt enamored with Kena: Bridge of Spirits throughout the entirety of its gorgeous adventure, but its gameplay and exploration doesn’t fully match the high expectations set by its stunning visuals. It’s got some solid combat that has just the right amount of challenge, some clever puzzles itching to be solved and plenty of nooks and crannies to explore. But the rewards for curious exploration aren’t always that exciting, and I wish I’d had more time getting to know the likeable Kena herself before the credits rolled. Still, Kena: Bridge of Spirits is a captivating and well-made affair with a big heart, and will surely scratch an itch for many gamers keen on taking part in a touching journey through one of the prettiest worlds ever created.                            
80	                                Ember Labs has established a solid foundation for a franchise that could eventually rival The Legend of Zelda. If future entries refine the combat and platforming, this could become one of the defining new series of this console generation.                            
80	                                Bridge of Spirits tackles the question of whether a game is worthwhile if it doesn’t innovate, and the answer is yes. Ember Lab’s biggest sin with Kena is just not following up on the unique identity hinted at throughout the journey, but never developed fully. That aside, Bridge of Spirits is still a rich and beautiful adventure with smart combat and superb platforming, and hopefully, it's not the last we hear from Ember Lab.                            
80	                                Kena: Bridge of Spirits is a great palette cleanser, not just in terms of tone but the way it's carefully designed. Well-paced and beautiful to behold with plenty to see and do, Ember Lab has well and truly captured the spirit of the 3D platformers many of us grew up adoring.                            
80	                                Kena: Bridge of Spirits delivers an all around excellent experience that's consistently engaging and manages to enrapture the player, even without doing anything particularly new or innovative.                            
80	                                Kena: Bridge of Spirits is one of the most charming platform adventures ever, with beautiful environments, characters and a compelling and exciting story. As far as gameplay is concerned, you've played these kinds of games many times before and technically the game isn't perfect, but it's packed in a masterful jacket.                             
80	                                Kena is an enjoyable adventure that mixes familiar elements with the occasional difficulty spike to shake things up. It plays it safe with simplistic combat and an old-school format, but its impressive presentation ultimately lulls you into its world nicely. Its cutscenes tell a story that leaves you curious for more, so here’s hoping that this is just the beginning of great things to come.                            
80	                                Kena Bridge of Spirits is more than a promising start from Ember Lab. Not only does it shine through its visuals and the presence of those little creatures called Rots, this action and adventure game that looks like an animated film offers an overall experience that is certainly a bit classic, a little young in some aspects, but perfectly condensed to allow both gameplay and storytelling to satisfy players who are looking for a nice trip to take after several periods of lockdown. Magical.                             
80	                                Kena: Bridge of Spirits is a fantastic achievement, one that celebrates the wonder of adventure games with a story to fall into, characters to root for and a ton of collectibles to uncover. The ‘Now That’s What I Call An Adventure Game’ nature of the mechanics offers little in the way of huge originality, but presents them in a world so full of beauty and wonder you’ll soon forget all about it. The future is bright for Ember Lab.                            
80	                                It is startling to think that one of the best games of the year has come in the form of a title that looks like something you would put on to amuse kids for a morning. Yet Kena: Bridge of Spirits boasts more heart and genuineness than many games could hope to exude. What Ember Lab has produced is a rejuvenation of the indie market, proving that the little guys can box with the best. For anyone looking for a game that will bring a smile to their face, Kena: Bridge of Spirits is not to be missed.                            
80	                                I’ve mentioned a lot of other games throughout this review. Uncharted, Jak & Daxter, Pikmin, I could name a few more too. While not a lot here is fully original, almost everything is well-executed, and when you add an excellent story and a ton of personality, you have a winning experience. While there are a few minor issues here and there, Kena: Bridge of Spirits provides a wonderful base that we can only hope future games will build on.                            
80	                                Ember Lab's very first project is a beautiful adventure set in an even more beautiful universe, and while it's borrowing a lot of its core components from different games of the genre, it still feels fresh and stands on its own. The future surely seems bright both for the franchise and its developer.                            
80	                                Kena: Bridge of Spirits remains traditional in its mechanics while offering a series of surprises that go far beyond the beauty of its world.                            
80	                                Despite featuring a very familiar experience inspired by The Legend of Zelda series, Kena: Bridge of Spirits manages to stand out from the competition with its amazing visuals, excellent combat system, and puzzle design. The underwhelming story and lack of real innovation prevent the game from being a must-have, sure, but what Kena: Bridge of Spirits does well, it really does well, so much that it's very easy to look past its issues.                            
80	                                Kena: Bridge of Spirits is a very good game that feels like it’s already been left behind by modern genre conventions. There’s nothing all that frustrating in that - we shouldn’t expect games, especially those made by studios the size of Ember Labs, to be constantly groundbreaking, but so much of Kena feels borrowed from elsewhere that it’s difficult to call it great. It’s a solid, enjoyable experience, and charming enough that you won’t care that you’ve played versions of it before. It doesn’t reinvent the wheel, but it’s a pretty nice wheel nonetheless.                             
80	                                I wouldn’t call Kena: Bridge of Spirits overly ambitious. More like “strategically ambitious.” Ember Lab avoided biting off more than it could chew with its first game, and I dug it. I hope there’s a sequel! After a much-deserved break, of course.                            
80	                                Despite a few shortcomings, Kena: Bridge of Spirits is a solid action-adventure game and an impressive debut effort by Ember Lab. It will scratch the itch for anyone looking for a Zelda-like adventure on PlayStation, but while it's been compared to games like Zelda and Pikmin, Kena: Bridge of Spirits still stands on its own. Hopefully, this isn't the end of Kena's story, as it would be great to see the ideas here expanded on in future games.                            
80	                                An agreeable adventure that's transformed into something special by its enchanting aesthetic.                            
80	                                With its elegantly simple combat and beautiful world, Kena: Bridge of Spirits harkens back to the days of the N64/GameCube-era Zeldas, Okami, and Star Fox Adventures, while also adding modern sensibilities and a distinct personal touch.                            
80	                                Kena: Bridge of Spirits is a majestic adventure in a world that blends life and death in a one-of-a-kind path of forgiveness and redemption. There are some imperfections due to inexperience but if this is the talent of the guys at Ember Lab, we can't wait to see what they can create in the future.                            
80	                                The story depicted in Kena is forgettable. But the journey to get there is absolutely not. Ember Labs gift us an artistic vision and an OST that are both splendid! The structure of the game is quiet classic and sometimes feels like routine but the fighting mechanics are incredible and the pleasure is undeniably there.                            
80	                                As an indie effort and a debut game, Kena: Bridge of Spirits makes a good impression. It balances simplicity and challenge while weaving a neatly-paced story into something that can be played over a chill couple of days. Despite fantastic production values it's still far from a AAA title – so it's important to keep expectations in check, but anyone looking to lose themselves in a charming, gorgeous world ripe for exploration should look no further. It's exactly what I needed right now – perfect cozy weekend entertainment.                            
77	                                Where Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart took an old formula and brought it into the modern era, Kena: Bridge of Spirits’ approach was more adherent to the old ways. The technical aspects are phenomenal and thoroughly current, but the game itself relies heavily on the old way of doing things. Limited paths. Contrived situational limitations. Collectables galore. You likely already know if that’s something you’re interested in playing, and I personally believe they’ve done an admirable job here. Especially for a first crack.                            
75	                                Kena is a visually appealing adventure with enjoyable gameplay. Although it has its shortcomings, it's a good start as Ember Lab's first game.                            
75	                                Kena: Bridge of Spirits features simple combat and often feels repetitive, but there's plenty of charm that keeps you playing.                            
75	                                Telling a number of touching tales of loss and love, Kena is a visually stunning action-platformer that feels like a classic PS2 game in mostly the right ways.                            
75	                                It’s not that it plays like a game from a different time, the overall design and flow is both time-worn and engaging -- it’s just that in certain areas it begins to feel a little disconnected. Secrets and treasure mostly come in the form of cute little hats for your Rot and the blue-crystal currency to buy more hats. So, the incentive to explore isn’t really there from a thematic or discovery context. We wish there was more finding spirits and restoring the village stuff as opposed to chests bursting open with a currency you never feel like you actually need.                            
75	                                Kena Bridge of Spirits may truly excel when it comes to a beautifully designed world and its gorgeous visuals and animation, but it can all feel relatively familiar, featuring platforming and combat mechanics that we’ve seen time and time again. Despite this, Ember Lab has created an action-adventure that can be enjoyed by players of all ages, weaving together Kena’s magical abilities, fantastic enemy designs, and a myriad of collectibles to uncover. Wherever the studio decides to take their next adventure, I’m excited to see it — hopefully with the return of The Rot.                            
70	                                A sprout that hasn’t quite managed to bloom. With expressive animation and beautiful art 7direction there’s lots to enjoy, but gameplay languishes in the shade. [Issue#7, p.80]                            
70	                                Whether you demand more than comfort from your games will inform the way you see Kena: Bridge of Spirits; is it merely a graphically sumptuous example of design that you wish we would leave behind, or is it a vivifying tribute to a rich precursor legacy?                            
70	                                Kena: Bridge of Spirit’s exceptional visuals clash with its unexceptional gameplay to create a gorgeous experience that would be forgettable if not for its technical prowess. Its combat, puzzles, and platforming are enjoyable but fail to set the world alight, though the adventure is elevated by the beauty of its open world and its highly animated characters.                            
70	                                Kena: Bridge of Spirits takes us on a whimsical tale that’s both predictable and familiar, but also something brand new with the way that it’s presented. Between the the back and forth moments of polish and unpolished gameplay lays an absolute gem of a game.                            
70	                                Despite borrowing from all manner of modern hits, Kena: Bridge of Spirits just about stands on its own. The wonderful visuals and music leave a strong impression, while the gameplay is simple but enjoyable. If its story went beyond the expected, and one or two small issues were scrubbed away, this would be a real winner. As it is, this is a solid action platformer with lots of personality, and a strong debut from Ember Lab.                            
60	                                It is pleasantly diverting, the kind of game it's easy to gobble up in a couple of long sittings - but equally there's little to really stir the blood. It may have gorgeous particle effects in abundance, but what it's really missing is a spark. [Issue#364, p.110]                            
60	                                A good first attempt by a studio that has only worked on animation, but not enough substance in the gameplay to keep you hooked to the very end.                            
60	                                For better and worse, the game lacks for the trailblazing go-anywhere spirit of Breath of the Wild.                            
60	                                As a debut game, Kena: Bridge Of Spirits excels with its cinematic visuals and polished gameplay that feels like a calling card for Ember Lab to be acquired by Sony if it was to revive its colourful mascot action-adventure platformers of old. However, it’s lacking its own personality and ideas while its lacklustre story means your feelings and memories of it will quickly move into the next world the moment you’re done with it.                            
60	                                Highly impressive on a technical level but the throwbacks to PS2 era game design feel less like a homage and more an indication of the developers’ lack of experience and imagination.                            
60	                                Kena: Bridge of Spirits is a completely inoffensive, if somewhat bland adventure that will mildly entertain for the duration of its runtime, but won’t live long in the memory.                            
90	                                Tails of Iron could go deeper on the story and lighter on the backtracking, but if it ever gets a sequel I hope it maintains obvious love seen in the art direction and design.                            
90	                                From milking bugs to slaying frogs with jetpacks, Tails of Iron is an off-the-walls, brilliantly intuitive sidescroller, but it has a heart and keeps you gripped from start to finish as you slaughter a conveyor belt of would-be challengers. It’s not about avenging your father, not entirely - it’s about family and community. Vin Diesel would be proud. Sadly, it’ll probably get lost in the busy end-of-year shuffle among the triple-A powerhouses. But in the downtime between releases, make some room for Tails of Iron - it’s one of 2021’s best.                             
85	                                Thanks to its enchanting art, well written story, heroic rodents and satisfying combat throughout, Tails of Iron stands apart from the seemingly endless wave of Soulslike ARPGs. It modifies the combat formula just enough to make it interesting and couples it with characters that are full of warmth and wit, battling forces that are competent yet fairly matched foes. Not every task and mission is equally interesting and some of Tails’ movement mechanics feel slightly unresponsive, but those are small dings against an otherwise very enjoyable rat-centric game, and we don’t have nearly enough of those.                            
82	                                Charming, funny, detailed and a great presentation are key aspects of this little gem. We would have hoped for more things to do, a bigger map and some more quests, but let's stay here until the sequel comes.                            
80	                                Although Tails of Iron is made with care, exploration and player freedom could be emphasized much more. Thrilling combat, meagre optional content and some simplified quests strewn over a small gameworld comprise a game of contradictions. We hope it is successful enough so that we can see a more ambitious sequel at some point.                            
78	                                Tails of Iron offers challenging combat along with some exploration touches with a shy metroidvania personality and some 2D platforming. And despite its little variety and a guided narrative, it offers an enjoyable game experience with some peaks in difficulty that represent quite a challenge. All this with an absolutely charming audiovisual presentation.                            
77	                                The small smudges reported up to this point do not compromise the experience as a whole. In the approximately 10 hours of gameplay required for completion, to which another handful is added to complete all the secondary ones left open, Tails of Iron constantly keeps the player's attention high, just like Redgi's shield. We are far from the complexity of a full-fledged souls-like, but the production of Odd Bug represents an engaging, at times exhilarating challenge, which will certainly keep even the most demanding players busy.                             
75	                                Even if Tails of Iron has some flaws, starting with its back and forth and its combat system that lacks evolution, the title is simply charming. Helped by its panoply of charismatic characters, its sumptuous visuals and its successful fights requiring precision and coordination, the creation of Odd Bug Studio offers a magnificent journey that we can only recommend ... at least, if the difficulty does not suit you. Don't be afraid.                             
70	                                The combat in Tails of Iron excels. The brutal, methodical mechanics never stop being satisfying, but I wish that I felt like I was doing it for more vital reasons. I can appreciate the artistic choice behind keeping things dialogue-free, I just wish the rest of the game felt as vital and interesting as the melee does.                            
70	                                Tails of Iron offers an unapologetically straightforward action platform that thrives in its simplicity, visceral combat system and nice-looking visuals.                             
90	                                It's safe to say that I think Hoa is an absolutely outstanding game. My childhood self would be shrieking with glee at this game as it is everything you could possibly wish for out of a nature based puzzle platformer. With adorable creatures to befriend and a story to learn, Hoa definitely has it all. Therefore I cannot recommend this game enough.                            
80	                                Hoa is a spirited adventure with a relaxing atmosphere. While I wish it were longer for its launch price (with optional challenges), I’m confident I’ll replay it. The desirable aesthetics combined with goal-driven gameplay are too enjoyable a combination. Did this puzzle platformer go unnoticed by you this summer? It’s never too late to give it the attention it deserves.                            
80	                                Young players still green to the simple story ideas and to platforming fundamentals will find absolute magic in Hoa. The orchestral score and hand-painted backdrops have the power to whisk imaginations away like nothing else. The tried-and-true design of a modern platform game, while unsurprising to seasoned players, will delight budding gamers getting to know the genre. Apart from its closing stage, Hoa is a paint-by-numbers platformer – and the painting is exceptional, even if everything stays carefully inside the lines.                            
80	                                Unravelling the narrative and exploring the carefully crafted world in Hoa is both satisfying and rewarding. Fans of puzzle games like Flower or Journey will find the same sense of peace and emotional fulfillment, while those who enjoy Studio Ghibli-inspired art like the Nino no Kuni series will likely appreciate the hand-painted characters and backgrounds. Hoa is a puzzle game worth playing multiple times, as every new journey through the magical landscape reveals further details, and remains just as delightful as the first playthrough.                            
75	                                Hoa is short and contains rather basic platforming and flawed controls. However, Hoa is also one of the most beautiful video games ever made, with preposterously strong visuals and music that will be remembered for years to come. It's up to you if the latter can make up for the former, but personally, I would recommend this game to almost anyone.                            
70	                                Hoa asserts itself as a nice little independent parenthesis, at the crossroads between the gameplay of Ori and an artistic direction at studio Ghibli. The latter is also a success in every way, whether in terms of sets, chara design or animation. A colorful dreamlike epic galvanized by Johannes Johansson's musical composition. Unfortunately if the visual is inspired and inspiring, it just lacks a dose of challenge and innovation in the gameplay to make the platform unforgettable. Two elements that can only be found in the conclusion of the work, enough to leave regrets.                            
70	                                Hoa looks to offer up a relaxing experience first and foremost though, and because of its amazing aesthetics it largely succeeds in this aim – but it’s still hard to overlook its lack of ambition in the gameplay department.                             
70	                                Hoa is a beautiful but brief puzzle-platform adventure that made for a relaxing evening’s worth of entertainment. It features no major physical threats nor any puzzles that are particularly obtuse, so cruising through its hand-painted slices of nature gave me a pleasantly zen-like experience. It’s a shame that the substantially more inventive final sequence wasn’t fleshed out even further, and I wish there were some additional reasons to explore its small selection of environments. But otherwise Hoa is a breezy little jaunt that’s all chilling and no killing.                             
60	                                It’s a shame Hoa doesn’t try to do more with its fantastic art design, as its non-challenging puzzle/platforming mechanics have already been employed more successfully by contemporaries. It might be beautiful, but Skrollcat Studio’s title offers a quietly milquetoast experience that reaches its anticlimactic conclusion before it has time to blossom.                            
60	                                Beyond such exquisite splendor from visual and musical perspectives, Hoa proves simple, if not simplistic, just like the adventure's minimalist, ephemeral nature may reflect the lack of original ideas. A nonetheless passionate tribute to Skrollcat Studios' wondrous inspirations.                             
60	                                Though nothing impacted gameplay (likely because there isn’t much to speak of), there were several instances of stutter that really marred the beautiful presentation on display. I understand that there is certainly an audience for the type of light gameplay experience that Hoa provides, and so long as you understand that going in you will at the very least be in for a treat with its visual and auditory splendor. And should you have someone who would benefit from how easy it is to play, Hoa could be the perfect fit, not to mention an excellent way of building admiration for the dying world around us.                            
55	                                Even in retrospect, it’s easy to look at Hoa and imagine possibilities that it just doesn’t fulfill. The way it contextualizes its mechanics is wonderful, but there’s not enough depth, risk, or complexity to complement those ideas. As a result, the brief experience becomes rather flat and routine.                            
100	                                Tales of Arise is so well done with the story, graphics, battle system, music, characters and voice cast that it is a must-play for anyone. Even if you aren’t normally a big fan of role-playing games the story is so compelling there is a lot to love here.                            
90	                                Tales of Arise sets a new gold standard for traditional action JRPGs. This stylized adventure's presentation and lavish production is a treat for anime fans and RPG enthusiasts, and it brings new life to the long-running Tales series.                            
90	                                Tales of Arise is a genuinely exceptional JRPG that does little wrong. The reworked combat mechanics aren't perfect, but in the grand scheme of things that doesn't matter. Its storytelling, character development, visuals, accessibility, and PC version quality have all been produced to world-class standards. Bandai Namco should be proud, and fans should be thrilled.                            
90	                                Bandai Namco combines excellent writing, stunning anime visuals, and a deep, rewarding combat system to make one of the best JRPGs of the year.                            
85	                                Tales of Arise is one of the best JRPG games of this year with its smooth PC version, great story and gameplay.                            
85	                                When it’s all said and done, Tales of Arise features a likeable cast of characters, compelling story and one of my new favorite combat engines, not just in the Tales series but in all the JRPGs I’ve played so far and if not for the pacing issues and the PC port’s technical issues, it could have set the bar for JRPGs to follow.                            
85	                                Tales of Arise is a solid entry into the series, yet I would be wary about recommending it to new players. Sure, you get some nice gameplay refinements and flashy graphics (indeed, it’s probably the best-looking game in the series hands down) but it hardly seems worth the $60 price tag, at least not when previous entries regularly go on sale $8 - $15. As I mentioned above, not that much has changed with the Tales series over the years, so there’s no reason to start with the newest and most expensive entry. However, if you’ve played and enjoyed previous entries in past, Tales of Arise becomes an easy recommendation as it showcases much of what makes the franchise so charming.                            
85	                                Tales of Arise brilliantly succeeds in breathing new life into the Tales Of saga. With its universe and its successful characters, the title delivers a striking adventure that takes advantage of superb environments thanks to a unique graphic rendering. The fights are not left out either since they show great intensity with always more spectacle, sometimes even if it means confusing the action. If we can blame it for his clipping, its talkative side, or its redundant bestiary, we still salute its many qualities which suggest good for the future of the series.                             
80	                                The Tales series makes a triumphant return with Arise, a game that delivers excellent, highly polished RPG action that stands above its predecessors. Despite being a RPG, Tales of Arise features a rich combat system that makes the title contend with some of the best action games released this year.                            
80	                                Tales of Arise is a strong addition to the "Tales of..." series that will surely satisfy those looking for a worthwhile JRPG experience. However, we must point out the timidity shown in not innovating and limiting itself to a standard scenario and a predictable structure. Perhaps that's why people love the series: because they know what to expect. So, if you do too, feel free to invest in Tales of Arise.                            
80	                                While it doesn’t end as well as it begins, Tales of Arise told a story I wanted to see through. Even when the plot dipped a bit in the back half, the wonderful cast of characters kept me engaged. Its combat never stopped being a blast either. This is the strongest Tales game in years and definitely worth checking out if you’re looking for a new adventure.                            
80	                                With its unique cast of characters, stunning watercolor world, and meaty combat system – Tales of Arise is a must-play for any JRPG fan. While it may not reinvent or bring anything new to the well-established genre, Bandai’s latest venture into the Tales series is both bigger, better, and bolder than ever before.                            
80	                                A traditional, but also very good JRPG that at first unnecessarilyconceals its strengths and only shows what it can do after around 15 hours.                            
95	                                As a result, we have a very highly detailed game where the story and gameplay are equally worthy of attention. Tales of Arise features a bright living world, peculiar charming heroes, dynamic battles that will keep you interested 50 hours in, interesting boss fights and exciting quests.                             
90	                                Tales of Arise feels like new blood in the Tales series veins, as it gathers all the qualities of the previous games, puts them together and takes them to the next level.                            
90	                                Tales of Arise is the perfect example of how a franchise can renew itself and achieve new quality standards. It's a JRPG with beautiful visuals and a fun, complex and spectacular battle system: a great game that you should not miss.                            
90	                                In short, Tales of Arise feels satisfying. It’s gorgeous to look at and the battles fun to experience.                            
86	                                Tales of Arise comes the most ambitious JRPG of the next-gen consoles, offering a great adventure with an excellent combat system and a soundtrack that will remain on the heart of fans of the saga for a long time.                             
80	                                Overall, it sometimes feels like just moving on from each area to the next, with not much else in-between. Tales of Arise is a beautiful game to look at, but the game goes by too quickly due to the relatively limited side-questing. The last release in the Tales series, Tales of Berseria, offered a lot of gameplay in terms of extra content, and the story was enough to wrench your heart out. Tales of Arise offers a very compelling story but not much else in terms of extra gameplay.                            
80	                                Tales of Arise presents a refreshing sense of nostalgia in a shiny new package. At times it can misfire between its lovable but inconsistent cast of characters and political narrative, but there’s still a band of loveable heroes brandishing the classic Tales archetypes I’ve always adored. Perhaps it wields subtlety like a cudgel—placing Shionne, the woman who causes pain, and Alphen, the man who can’t feel pain, together—yet it’s that same ungraceful melodrama I remember being so fond of a decade ago. Arise elevates Tales back into the RPG spotlight, but it doesn’t leave the pieces of the past you loved behind.                             
80	                                Tales of Arise is a Tales game through and through. It's polished and consistently enjoyable, and it features an excellent combat system. The story and characters are not particularly ambitious or distinct, but they give you a fun world to explore for the 40+ hour runtime. In an era where "safe" JRPGs are uncommon, it's nice to have one that does exactly what it promises. It's not the best or worst of the series, but it is a darn fun Tales title that lives up to the franchise's name.                            
80	                                A successful attempt to modernise and broaden the appeal of the Tales series without completely abandoning its JRPG roots.                            
75	                                Dedicated fans of the genre will find exactly what they were looking for here. While its pacing doesn’t treat players’ time as well it could, Tales of Arise is an enjoyable, memorable action RPG.                            
60	                                Tales of Arise is not so much an evolution of the Tales series as it is an awkward game that backs up decent combat with a bland, uninspired story and characters.                            
89	                                Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy is for the most part a very enjoyable experience. A pure singleplayer title with a beefy campaign (at least 15-20 hours), smart and quality writing, great presentation and faithfulness to the universe it translates to game form.                            
85	                                The plot meanders and the game is somewhat too long, but it's still a great time and well worth experiencing for Guardians fans.                            
85	                                Guardians of the Galaxy is a solid single-player game with a strongstory, the combat however is in desperate need of more fine-tuning.                            
80	                                Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy on PC performs very well. It is the best version on a purely aesthetic level. The work done by Eidos to recreate the galaxy, the planets and its protagonists is incredible.                            
80	                                With its endearing characters and effective humor, Guardians of the Galaxy is one of the pleasant surprises of the end of the year, which is obviously aimed at a very large audience. Behind this careful writing, we feel a deep love on the part of the developers of Eidos Montreal for its marginalized space. And if the adventure is not as epic as we hoped, the journey is nonetheless pleasant with its moments of complicity and the many choices offered which reinforce the player's involvement. A truly attractive journey, in particular thanks to an efficient and fluid combat system which nevertheless shows its limits at the end of the game and against the bosses. Finally, it is more on its visual part that the title can divide. If we find on the one hand original environments and neat character models, we also note the presence of less convincing facial animations in places and sometimes less fine landscapes. It is nonetheless a gripping adventure alongside the galaxy's greatest magnificent losers that has plenty to please MCU fans.                             
80	                                Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy is a highly enjoyable action/adventure romp that never strays from the beaten path. You won't find any major experiments or innovations here, but you will experience a great adaptation of the beloved dysfunctional team of galactic superheroes. The story and characters are well written, the combat is fun (if perhaps a bit too easy), and the audio is excellent.                            
75	                                More than a mainstream game for fans, Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy is a real hit that wasn't expected. Of course, being a fan of Star Lord and Rocket's humour will help you enjoy the game, but the single-player adventure offered by Eidos Montreal can suit anyone who likes the genre. A successful art direction, a pleasing energy, omnipresent dialogues and music plus dynamic fights make this new title an explosive condensation of good things succeeding in making us forget the few negative points such as a certain slowness in some chapters and the impossibility to embody the other guardians.                            
70	                                Imagine watching this movie for 15 hours. Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy makes a great impression at first, but as you pass time, it makes you feel like it's a monotonous game.                            
70	                                Guardians of the Galaxy mostly nails the quirky tone and characters that Marvel fans will be hoping for. Otherwise strong presentation is marred by a few too many visual glitches, but if you can tolerate these and some repetitive combat, it's worth a look.                            
70	                                A surprisingly good time when you're not forced to reload your checkpoint after a game-breaking bug.                            
70	                                For superhero games in particular, Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy is a breath of fresh air that demonstrates just how much fun, and how innovative, single-player games remain.                            
90	                                Remaining addictive and compelling throughout, I’m in love with Dungeon Encounters. Ito, Kato and Uematsu make for an absolute dream, being a key part of what makes this the best and most vibe filled rogue-lite experience of the year. Where its minimalistic design may off-put, it’s more than worth moving past that and exploring the genius and wonder on offer. Level readability is so concise and polished. Puzzle design is clever and stimulating, flexing muscles in the brain I haven’t used in years. ATB combat is back and thriving, being the best it’s ever been. Layers upon layers of depth are offered here. There’s so much magic in Dungeon Encounters. I only pray people find the time out of the heavy influx of games to give this one a shot. If you do, you’re in for an amazing ride.                            
90	                                Dungeon Encounters is a hardcore experience, that some will dismiss as overly simple. More fool them.                            
85	                                If you’re looking for an epic, grand story with a vibrant presentation, you won’t find that here. But if you just want raw and engrossing exploration and turn-based combat, Dungeon Encounters delivers in spades.                            
80	                                Dungeon Encounters is a pared-back RPG focused purely on battles and exploration. By gaining knowledge and experience, the player needs to learn how to overcome traps and enemies, resulting in a satisfying experience. Although the game kind of loses momentum in the second half, it’s still well worth a look.                            
80	                                Dungeon Encounters is not going to be for everyone. It’s not even going to be for most. But if you relish the idea of a challenging, no-frills dungeon crawl with a familiar yet slightly novel battle system, a game that cuts the genre right down to its gameplay skivvies? This is it. I can’t imagine a better realization of such an objective, no matter how niche a target it may be. Maybe if it had better music. Just be warned that the game may well bring you closer to spiking your controller than you’ve been in a while.                            
80	                                Dungeon Encounters is a masterstroke of game design, character and narrative – it’s storytelling in the way only games can be. It teaches how scale is felt in a game, and it teaches, through their absence, the roles of rich visuals and verbose storytelling. Next time we play an RPG with baroque graphics and forests of text, we will understand a little more deeply where a game’s atmosphere really comes from.                            
80	                                There’s so much to Dungeon Encounters. People might not even notice at a first glance. But the systems at play are so compelling and rewarding. Finding a new item. Beating a party of foes that stumped you before. Managing to track down a wandering adventure. Saving a party of fallen allies that died earlier because you overestimated your abilities. It’s enthralling. And given the nature of the Switch, it is even more satisfying playing Dungeon Encounters there in any situation and taking tons of notes. It’s one of my favorite surprises in 2021.                            
80	                                The Japanese role-playing game stripped back to its bare essentials and yet rather than an exercise in nostalgic pandering this is one of the most compelling and sharply designed dungeon crawlers of recent years.                            
78	                                Smart, minimal, fast and engaging, Dungeon Encounters is a good old-school JRPG experience, with a hardcore soul that arises after some playtime. Maybe even too much hardcore.                            
70	                                 Dungeon Encounters is deceptive engaging. What seems at first to be a no-frills dungeon crawler, sliced back to its very minimum eventually reveals itself to be quite the clever little project. It provides the very basic foundation needed for a JRPG, and then gets out of the way, letting the player write their own story and fill in the metaphoric (and literal) blanks in their own way. That makes it an oddly cathartic experience.                            
60	                                An engaging battle system in a slim package, Dungeon Encounters still offers some good hours.                            
100	                                Lone Echo II is a pristine example of how a sequel can be better than the original in every way. More mature and varied gameplay elements, impressive graphics, and a story that wouldn't feel out of the place in a novel make this the must-have swan song of the Rift platform.                            
100	                                There’s a lot to love and get engrossed in as it’s so immersive, the real criticism comes from the fact that Lone Echo II plays everything a little too safe. The experience doesn’t break any new ground and it really could’ve done with some greater challenges thrown in. On the other hand, it was engrossing until the very end, easily the standout AAA VR experience of 2021.                                  
92	                                Lone Echo II proves once again how Read at Dawn is a top-of-the-class developer when it comes to VR.                            
88	                                Lone Echo II is a gem of a VR game and a true AAA production in this niche.                            
80	                                Lone Echo II is available on PC and we dabbled in it to finish the adventure that started 4 years ago! If the scenario is in direct line with the previous one, it will bring its share of surprises, time travel and a much more definitive conclusion than before. The VR gameplay is inherited and almost modeled on that of the first episode: you move weightlessly with the strength of your arms or your jetpack, and you have to wander around a crumbling space station and fix it and relaunch it with it. the few tools that are at your disposal. Whether through its universe or the experience offered in virtual reality, Lone Echo II is worth its weight in peanuts, and if you are equipped and have already completed the first, we advise you to see the end of the adventure.                            
80	                                Lone Echo II boldly crafts a stunning and near-perfect space sim, but repetition and lack of replay value aren't enough to pass on Oculus' last Rift exclusive.                            
80	                                Gripping VR space adventure with excellent immersion and good graphics.                            
80	                                Lone Echo 2 is just as much a solid blend of narrative and puzzle solving in the VR space as the first one was and continues to show Ready at Dawn has a winning formula for VR players of all styles and comfort levels. [Tested with Oculus Quest 2 via link to PC]                            
75	                                Lone Echo II is in the right lineage of the first episode and above all enhances a formula that has proven itself. We therefore find a very endearing duo, an ultra-immersive weightless control system, a clever scenario and a classic science-fiction universe, but well developed. However, he can be criticized for relying a little too much on the qualities of the initial game as well as a jagged pace, in particular because of a somewhat sluggish start to the adventure. Still, this is a must-see sequel if you loved the previous game and are eager to uncover Jack and Liv's fate.                             
75	                                Lone Echo II brings us more about what we loved from the first game, but plays it quite safe and doesn't break much new ground. While it's nice to be introduced to some new and important characters, they don't see much development, which contributes to a plot that doesn't feel very impactful. The game doesn't do much to challenge the player in combat or puzzles, but it excels in immersion. Between its intuitive zero-G locomotion and (at times) open map design, it's just a bit magical to feel like you're really outside of a derelict space station orbiting Saturn. The game could have benefited from better pacing and a bit more threat and tension, but if you liked doing space chores the first time around, you'll enjoy it here too.                            
60	                                Lone Echo 2 is an enjoyable space drama with striking details and fun movement mechanics, but it lacks innovation and struggles to justify its eight-hour runtime.                            
60	                                Lone Echo 2’s incredible production values and first-rate immersion make for an enjoyable swansong that’s let down by its plodding pace and familiarity. Despite arriving four years after the groundbreaking original, there’s very little that will surprise you here and, although well written, the drawn-out character dialogue quickly wears thin. It’s still held up by a fantastic locomotion system with first-rate immersion alongside a solid story with believable performances, but the startling spark of blockbuster innovation that fuelled the first game has long-since died out. Jack and Liv’s mission to get back to the past makes for a fun ride, but parts of Lone Echo 2 were stuck there to begin with.                            
100	                                Tetris Effect: Connected came out as an eShop exclusive. I downloaded it at midnight the night it launched and played until about six in the morning. It was so mesmerizing and fun that I couldn’t stop playing it until I’d seen and heard every stage it had to offer. That might make it sound like the game is on the short side, but assuming most players take their time with the campaign, I can see it stretching out to six or seven hours to complete. Throw in the various modes and multiplayer, and Tetris Effect: Connected will keep players coming back to it for a very long time. I can’t recommend it enough—it’s a must-have for Switch owners.                            
100	                                Tetris Effect: Connected is a must-play game, and should not be missed by anyone.                            
100	                                There’s barely anything we can say against Tetris Effect: Connected. It’s a fantastically fresh take on a puzzler that refuses to age. This Switch iteration is the definitive way to play the game thanks to the handheld element too.                            
100	                                Tetris Effect remains the best version of Tetris on the market, and the Nintendo Switch port is hardly compromised, successfully retaining what made the game stunning in the first place. The added portability of the Switch version is more than enough reason to double-dip, and it looks wonderful on the OLED Model's new screen if you're fortunate enough to have the upgraded console. The Switch has become our personal platform of choice when it comes to Tetris Effect: Connected, but regardless of platform, this is a special title that absolutely deserves all the praise it's received over the last few years.                            
100	                                Tetris Effect: Connected is an incredible experience top to bottom whether playing alone or with others in the newly added competitive modes. Its effortless blending of stunning visuals and euphoric music make this so much more than just a mere puzzle game though. It’s a sensory overload, an uplifting journey and even an emotional one at times where every moment spent is nothing short of mesmerising.                            
100	                                Tetris Effect: Connected is not only the best Tetris game of all time, it's one of the best puzzle games ever. This will change your life.                            
100	                                Tetris Effect: Connected has reached the point where it can cater to just about any player, with each platform having its own particular strengths, from those looking to lose themselves to VR to just having it there on Game Pass as a convenient pick-me-up. The Switch release further expands those options as one that you can take anywhere, while also being a terrific advert for the new OLED model. Whichever version you opt for, there’s no denying that it’s quite simply a modern masterpiece, whether as a meditation on life, an excuse to challenge the universe, or making a connection with strangers.                            
100	                                Tetris Effect: Connected takes what is basically a perfect game whose only drawback is how familiar it is and recontextualizes it with a jaw-dropping presentation and some interesting new modes. I’m aware that the Nintendo Switch has a lot of great ways to play Tetris already, but I think this game does more than enough to justify itself in the face of those. It’s probably not going to convince anyone who doesn’t like Tetris, but apart from those six people it’s hard to imagine anyone being disappointed with this game.                            
100	                                Tetris is one of the greatest video games of all time, and Tetris Effect: Connected is perhaps the best iteration of the classic puzzler yet. While this Switch port doesn't offer a great deal over existing versions in terms of features, it delivers the one key ingredient that its rivals cannot: portability. Sure, some will argue that Tetris Effect: Connected's unique brand of synesthesia only really comes alive when played on PSVR or an Oculus Quest headset, but we'd argue quite passionately that this game benefits far more from the ability to pick it up and play whenever, wherever. Just as the Game Boy and Tetris combined to create an irresistible, world-conquering fusion back in 1989, Tetris Effect: Connected has finally found the hardware that allows it to truly shine, making this an utterly essential purchase for all Nintendo Switch owners. Just don't forget those headphones.                            
95	                                Tetris Effect: Connected is an outstanding iteration of the beloved puzzler, featuring unique levels with mind-boggling visuals. Playing docked doesn't look as great as in handheld mode (particularly on Switch OLED) due to Switch resolution differences, but that doesn't detract from the overall experience. If you're after a fantastic puzzle game on Nintendo Switch, then Tetris Effect: Connected is an easy recommendation.                            
95	                                Tetris Effect: Connected is one of the best Nintendo Switch games you can play today and a perfect complement to the amazing Tetris 99. If you haven't gotten it yet, the Switch conversion is brilliant and well worth your time. Hopefully it gets a physical release soon.                            
95	                                I love Tetris Effect: Connected because it keeps reminding me why I love video games. There’s really nothing else quite like it. If you think this is just another game of Tetris, I urge you especially to give this game a try. Who knows? It may even change your life.                            
90	                                Tetris Effect: Connected finally lands on the Nintendo Switch and therereally is no other way to describe it than as a true feast for thesenses. This sensorial experience is an absolute marvel at every level -visual, sound, gameplay - and full of options for every taste andpreference, as well as solo and multiplayer modes. Tetris Effect:Connected is an essential work that will go hand-in-hand with everyNintendo Switch out there and which every single player should get theirhands on.                            
90	                                Tetris Effect: Connected is the puzzler as you’ve never seen it before. The whole experience is amped to the max, producing a game that dazzles not only the brain but the eyes and ears as well.                            
90	                                Tetris Effect: Connected is perhaps the best Tetris will ever be. If you enjoy the classic block puzzle game and like the idea of playing to a backdrop of beautiful audio and visuals, then you’ll absolutely love it. With a huge amount of content, including a truly original multiplayer mode, this really is an incredible game – and it feels right at home in a handheld format. Sorry Tetris 99, you’re not the Switch’s best Tetris game anymore.                            
90	                                Beautiful visuals, a stellar soundtrack, a plethora of great modes, all wrapped around one of the most mechanically perfect video games ever made, Tetris Effect: Connected is an essential puzzle game and a perfect match for anyone with the OLED Switch.                            
90	                                It may lack some of the visual flair seen on more powerful platforms, and in handheld mode, headphones are all but necessary to appreciate the intense rhythm of levels like Ritual Passion that rely so heavily on the blend of hypnotic visuals and incredible audio to deliver Effect's uniquely euphoric experience. But even with those minor caveats, Effect remains the best version of Tetris out there, and Switch is a great place to play it.                            
90	                                A perfect port for a perfect game, Tetris Effect: Connected it's the best puzzle video game ever created, transformed into an experience for the senses. An absolute must have.                            
85	                                Tetris is Tetris, so well known and broadly adored. And even if Tetris Effect: Connected is familiar, it’s still great fun. The refinements make it a worthy addition to your Switch library, even if some of the tunes can be hit or miss. It’ll scratch that Tetris itch, offering rewarding challenges you can return to time after time, even for those who’ve been manipulating shaped blocks since Alexey Pajitnov’s original.                             
96	                                Rainbow Billy: The Curse of the Leviathan is a near perfect game and a great introduction as someone's first RPG. It may be a little long winded at times, but overall Rainbow Billy is a must own.                            
90	                                Rainbow Billy: The Curse of the Leviathan is a wonderfully crafted 2.5D adventure game that features well-made puzzles and engaging platforming sequences. Its surprisingly intricate confrontation mechanic coupled with the underlying messages about complex social issues ensure that this is a game for all ages, not just kids. It does a fantastic job of encouraging exploration and is overall a game well worth playing regardless of if you fit in with its core target audience or not.                            
85	                                Rainbow Billy: The Curse of the Leviathan is a fun and wholesome platformer-RPG with a charming aesthetic and engaging nonviolent gameplay for gamers of all ages.                            
80	                                Rainbow Billy: The Curse of the Leviathan is a good entry into the RPG and 2.5D platforming genres that will give newer and younger players a taste of what similar games of this genre should look like. Its charm, simplicity, and accessibility can become overshadowed by the amount of conversation, but those who love reading will have a good time with this game. It’s beautifully charming, and it was clearly made with love. Just be sure to temper your expectations.                            
80	                                Rainbow Billy is a positive and colourful adventure from start to finish, but the lack of challenge prevents it from reaching its full potential.                            
80	                                Rainbow Billy: the Curse of the Leviathan does a fantastic job of balancing its cute world without making its gameplay too juvenile. Battle systems, in particular, are complex enough for different play styles around, given a player’s preference. Characters and dialogue are sweet but without sap that is sometimes associated with more wholesome games like this. For those looking for a fun and comforting RPG experience, Rainbow Billy: the Curse of the Leviathan may be the colorful journey to embark upon.                            
65	                                Rainbow Billy: The Curse of the Leviathan is a cute and cuddly family RPG that sacrifices depth for accessibility. This lack of substance may turn off older players who may be used to more complex affairs, but younger players and their parents will discover a great way to get acquainted with a popular genre of games.                            
95	                                Each of these games is an excellent individual effort and would be well worth revisiting alone. All together, for the equivalent of a few bucks apiece, the value is incredible! [Issue #56 – November/December 2021, p. 28]                            
90	                                Ultimately, there’s a lot of quality adventuring to be had here however – with Aria of Sorrow in particular still one of the best entries in the entire Castlevania series.                            
90	                                Castlevania Advance Collection sets the standard for how older games should be preserved and presented to a modern audience. There are many quality of life features to make the games more accessible while keeping everything that made them special in the first place.                            
90	                                To be clear, it’s mostly Aria of Sorrow that’s doing the heavy lifting with this collection, as it really is one of the best in the entire Castlevania series. Circle and Harmony are alright but on the lower tier of the other Metroidvanias, while Dracula X is middling even on its own standards. These are still very much worth playing, though, and this collection makes for an essential purchase for both longtime Castlevania fans and newbies.                            
90	                                If you’re at all a fan of Metroidvanias and haven’t played most of these games, there’s no reason to wait. Not every game here is perfect, but they’re all at least good. Circle of the Moon provides the best mix between the old and new style of Castlevania, while Aria of Sorrow is an absolute triumph that holds up beautifully even after all these years. Harmony of Dissonance has more flaws but is still mostly an excellent play, and even Dracula X is a very solid title. I would have loved to see more work done to provide a total package here, but few collections have ever provided a better set of titles.                            
90	                                Konami has pulled off a great collection here, filled with great GBA games (and a bonus one from the SNES), awesome new features and great presentation. I have very few gripes with this collection - it's a must-have for Castlevania and Metroidvania enthusiasts.                            
87	                                Though Castlevania: Symphony of the Night was the first entry to truly embrace 2D exploration and non-linear progression, it was in these three GBA titles that the “-vania” was permanently affixed to the “Metroid.” Individually, they are fantastic games, and together, they offer an irresistible package to fans of the series and genre. Our reviewers very much enjoyed each game in the collection, and we highly recommend it to those looking for engaging, challenging, and expertly crafted Metroidvania games!                            
84	                                Castlevania: Advance Collection is another good collection from Konami and M2, considering both its content and execution. Even if limited to the same series, there is a good variety of experiences in this Advance Collection, with games that - although aged differently - can still be really enjoyable at this day and age.                            
80	                                Castlevania Advance Collection is exactly the jolt of excitement Konami’s classic series of gothic action-platformers needs to succeed. All games featured look and play great, with newly installed quality-of-life features making them more accessible.                            
80	                                Collecting three superb Castlevania entries from the Game Boy Advance era and one more obscure SNES offering, this is a must-have for any fan of the genre that Castlevania carved out.                            
80	                                So while the bells and whistles aren’t necessarily anything to write home about, the GBA games at the core of this Castlevania Advance Collection are easily worth the price of admission. I remain flummoxed and annoyed that Konami is holding Rondo of Blood and Symphony of the Night hostage for the time being, but hopefully that will be resolved someday.                            
80	                                A good selection of classic titles, that has both masterpieces –Aria of Sorrow justifies the price tag by itself– and more divisive entries.                            
80	                                A very narrow selection of games, from a format that does not work well on modern TVs, but Aria Of Sorrow in particular stands out as one of the best Castlevania games ever made.                            
80	                                It's hard to sulk your pleasure in front of this Castlevania Advance Collection. For twenty euros, players can discover and rediscover three essentials of the Game Boy Advance. If the weather hasn't been so good with the SNES opus, Harmony of Dissonance, Aria of Sorrow and Circle of the Moon haven't aged a bit. So now is the perfect opportunity to add 3 great metroidvania to your collection. Too bad only one of them benefits from a French translation.                             
80	                                Some games age not well. Others can come back as often as they want, they will have no trouble charming their audience. The three Game Boy Advance Castlevania are still, 20 years later at a very good overall level. Playing them on larger screens, with a few welcome adjustments, can't be refused, whether you have a little nostalgia, the desire to perfect your culture or a good appetite for the Metroidvania subgenre. If we still hope for other intentions from Konami, this kind of compilation, with an Aria of Sorrow which remains one of the best parts of the saga, has no reason to be sulked.                             
75	                                A unique opportunity to re-enjoy Castlevania GBA editions with the addition of Castlevania X. Full of extras and quality of life options for added enjoyment, but very poor in terms of video games included.                            
90	                                Blue Reflection: Second Light is a good sequel. It improves many aspects of the original game while being entertaining and a cool JRPG. Despite a few shortcomings, any Gust fan will have a blast with it.                            
90	                                Blue Reflection: Second Light improves on almost every aspect of the original, with a mystery that feels more personal as the characters become closer. The relationship between the girls as they seek to discover why they were brought to this strange world is the star of the show; though the combat is fun, it is always a vehicle to get you more story rather than the driving force of the game. Second Light is a fantastic-looking anime adventure that you'll love, so long as you can accept that combat isn't the focus.                            
85	                                Blue Reflection: Second Light provides an intriguing story and challenging battles despite its derivative gameplay. As such, I’d easily recommend it to fans of both anime and JRPGs.                             
80	                                Ultimately, Blue Reflection: Second Light is another high-quality effort from Gust. Its unique setting, strong character work, and attractive presentation are the highlights here, but it doesn’t outright drop the ball in any categories. If you’re looking for a cozy, low-stress RPG to spend some time with, Blue Reflection: Second Light makes a compelling case. Those who, like me, caught on to Gust with the Atelier Ryza games will certainly want to check this game out. It has many of the same charms, but with enough differences to make it stand on its own.                            
80	                                BLUE REFLECTION: Second Light is a surprisingly deep JRPG, both mechanics and story wise, without overwhelming the player in either area. The cast of characters are all unique and likeable, and alongside the interesting story, the attachment you gain for the cast aids you in your pursuit for answers. The battle system is fun and boss battles are especially tense. Despite the repetitiveness of some enemies, and the overuse of cutscenes, this is a great game that I’ll be diving back into the confirmed higher difficulty when released later this year.                            
75	                                Although it falls just short of the similar (but more intricate) Atelier games, those who enjoyed them will be entertained by Blue Reflection: Second Light. The fun characters, moving story, and familiar (albeit lighter) crafting / battle systems typical of Gust games are a great way to fill the time while we await the release of Atelier Sophie 2.                            
75	                                Despite visual cutbacks, Blue Reflection: Second Light on Nintendo Switch is a fine way to experience a very good and relaxing JRPG. The game itself has one annoying mechanic, but is still worth playing if you're a fan of Gust's output. Hopefully it does well enough to get a port of the original game for Nintendo Switch.                            
70	                                A slower-paced J-RPG but which offers a calm and soothing experience that will especially appeal to fans of Japanese productions.                             
70	                                Blue Reflection: Second Light is pretty much exactly what I expected Blue Reflection 2 to be. It’s a very relaxed sort of RPG. Even though there are mysteries to solve and danger, I didn’t feel pressured. Rather, I felt encouraged to talk with people around me and take my time as I crafted, explored, and fought through its world. But also, I feel like I came into it with the best mindset. I played the original game and watched Blue Reflection Ray. People who aren’t as into Gust games and everything they entail—which can involve crafting, gathering, and perhaps sometimes a slower pace than other RPGs—might not be as into it. But those familiar with Gust’s work or perhaps looking for a new adventure after Atelier Ryza might want to, at the very least, check out the demo.                            
70	                                I had a lot of fun during my time with Blue Reflection: Second Light. A colorful world filled with interesting characters and some of my favorite JRPG combat in a long time makes for a consistently entertaining play. I just wish the main story ever really became interesting. As a slice of life RPG, Second Light succeeds. As an apocalyptic epic, though, it falls short. This leaves a total package that lies somewhere in the middle.                            
65	                                Blue Reflection Second Light is not a game that will suit everyone, but it remains interesting on several aspects. Whether it is for the diversity of its environments, or the improvements compared to the previous game, which allow our heroines to evolve a little as we want. This second opus brings a bit of freshness with its new fighting system and it's encouraging for the future. And if you are interested, we advise you to test the demo.                            
100	                                Project Zero: Maiden of Black Water is so deeply Japanese that you’ll come away from it learning a bit about the wonderful horror storytelling tradition that the culture has. While some might find themselves at odds with a game that is so steadfastly traditional about how a horror game should play (especially on the back of the very modern Resident Evil: Village this year), if you go in with an open mind, understanding the cultural context that has lead to the game turning out this way, then you’re going to find it to be a really remarkable and enlightening bit of art. It’s not unlike going to an art gallery for a yurei exhibition, really.                            
90	                                The new version of Fatal Frame: Maiden of Black Water comes with improved graphics and some new content, but it would be a game worth playing even without them. Although it’s occasionally more frustrating than scary, the clever gameplay and its dedication to tone and story make it one of the best survival horror games available for the Switch.                            
90	                                Project Zero: Maiden of Black Water isn’t scary so much as haunting, and that’s an important distinction. Where plenty of horror games begin and end with trying to scare the pants off their players, this one looks for something much deeper, and turns to the long, rich history of yūrei folklore to find it. That’s what I missed when I first played it five years ago, but a remaster is a perfect opportunity to revisit and reassess—and I’m so glad I did. This is a game that deserves a far better reception than it originally got, and I just hope I’m not alone in giving it the benefit of the doubt a second time round.                             
80	                                Project Zero: Maiden Black Water is a good survival horror game, despite the fact that its new contents are not too abundant. However, its great setting and interesting plot make it a highly recommended title, now also in portable mode.                            
80	                                Overall Fatal Frame: Maiden of Black Water is a fun action horror adventure to play through, with the specters of Mt. Hikami providing an interesting backstory and a fun combat experience. While the characters are more bland than I had hoped, this doesn't necessarily take away from the story all that much. Some control issues do get annoying over time, but even they couldn't stop me from continuously returning to the beautiful and creepy environments of the mountain. If you're a fan of horror games with a bit more of an action feel, you could certainly do a lot worse than Fatal Frame, and now might just be the perfect time to dive in.                            
80	                                There's a lot to like about Maiden of Black Water; while we didn't find it overly scary, it is very good indeed at being eerie. You'll see ghosts out of the corner of your eye and when you check, they'll be gone. It's oddly cosy and non-stressful for a horror game, because your camera is such an efficient weapon and the combat it propogates is too action-packed to really let any dread sink in. That's not necessarily a bad thing, though we found the earlier PlayStation 2 instalments of the series were more interested in actively frightening the player. If you get absorbed in the storyline — which is easy to do as the episodic structure makes "just one more area" a compelling prospect — you'll find a good 15 or so hours of game here, and much more if you decide you need to get higher ranks as you improve your Camera Obscura with upgrades and other boons. Performance problems aside, this game's a real winner and worth snapping up if you're a horror fan who missed it on Wii U.                            
75	                                Maiden of Black Water is a twisted and engaging experience. Though it has shortcomings, they never diminish the powerful storytelling and atmosphere. I might be too squeamish to comfortably endure the title’s cathartic terror, those brave enough to venture forth will surely be rewarded with a suitably haunting adventure.                             
75	                                Fatal Frame: Maiden of Black Water on Nintendo Switch is a great-looking conversion of an excellent horror adventure game that only falters on the performance side of things. It remains one of the better horror experiences on the system and a great game to play this Halloween.                            
73	                                Fatal Frame: Maiden of Black Water is a very good throwback to the weirder survival horror games found on the PS2. It features a looming horror atmosphere I really enjoyed, and a unique gameplay hook with its motion controlled first person camera. While it’s not going to win any game of the year awards, I would think that Fatal Frame: Maiden of Black Water should be a must play for all survival horror fans, especially with its budget price.                            
70	                                Project Zero: Maiden of Black Water is a remaster that does a lot ofthings right, and which shows that the series still has the ability todeliver a good amount of frights. While the opportunity to implement amore functional control system was not taken and there are sometechnical performance issues, the overall effort is a work that's verysatisfactory to explore, especially thanks to its high quality leveldesign.                            
70	                                Fatal Frame: Maiden of Black Water should please fans of the franchise who missed out on the game due to its previous Wii U-exclusive status, but not everyone is going to be pleased with some of its clunkier elements. While you aren’t helpless enough to make the game as terrifying as it could be, it’s certainly an unsettling and fascinating experience with plenty to offer those who want a hearty meal of fear on their Nintendo Switch system.                            
70	                                Maiden of the Black Water is a game that I would recommend to any fan of the genre. While the awkward controls and deadpan voice acting may detract from the experience, the world building and design are second to none.                            
60	                                Ultimately the premise of ghost hunting using your camera to defeat them is much better than the execution in Maiden of Black Water. At first, it's easy to get caught up in the dark dread-filled environments, keeping the spirits at bay with your Camera Obscura. Then you're returning to the same places, with long drawn-out moments broken up by ghost fights that go on too long when they get stuck in a wall. If you're not already a Project Zero/Fatal Frame fan, this game might not be the one to get you into the series.                            
60	                                Those who love the genre and will be able to forgive its many pitfalls.                            
60	                                Fatal Frame Maiden of the Black Water in 2021 is just a port of the 2015's game, with nothing more than a few outfits and a Photo Mode. If you want some scary experience before Halloween, or are a fan of the franchise, you'll get exactly what you are looking for, with the same camera issues and a few technical hiccups.                             
60	                                So much of Fatal Frame: Maiden of Black Water holds promise. Ultimately, its execution and lackluster story lets it down. Just like how I wanted to love this game upon its initial release, I want to love it now. But there is just so much that prevents it from being a great entry in the series. And it’s a shame that the future of the series hinges on what remains ultimately one of the worst Fatal Frame titles to date.                            
50	                                Enemy encounters are also made annoying by the fact that your character’s movement feels like you’re trying to weave through a busy train. You pull back on the thumbstick to move backwards, and instead the avatar does a mindless dance around the space they’re in. Try to position yourself just right to avoid an enemy attack, and you’ll spend a great deal of time fumbling around with the controls that you’ll get hit anyway. With most of the playable areas being so tight and close-quartered, why do we even have the option to dodge an enemy attack when they’ll end up getting you anyway?                            
80	                                While it’s a bizarrely difficult racing game for one to be heavily marketed towards younger kids, Hot Wheels Unleashed somehow matches to capture everything we used to pretend Hot Wheels were when we played with them as children. The stages feel real and the sense of perspective is amazing. Fully customizable vehicles with one of the best track editors I’ve ever seen make this game a fun toy chest to play with.                            
80	                                Hot Wheels Unleashed is a remarkable arcade driving game that will delight fans of toy cars and attract a good number of speed arcade players. It has content for dozens of hours and adds the component of collecting, although the way to get all the vehicles and some ways to discover its secrets can be a bit strange.                            
75	                                Hot Wheels Unleashed is hard. Like, unnecessarily so. I hope that the developers, after reading feedback about the too-tough difficulty level, will patch the game to be more accessible to Hot Wheels' biggest fans: small kids! [Issue #56 – November/December 2021, p. 72]                            
75	                                Hot Wheels Unleashed is the Hot Wheels racing game that we have been waiting on for a while. It delivers outside of a few hiccups. Players with concerns about performance will likely want to hold off until the upcoming patch releases on Switch. Players will also have to sit through some slow progression to really start unlocking cool cars, but they will have some very fun racing to keep them busy in between blind boxes and upgrades. If you are looking for a fun, methodical racer and you can appreciate toy cars and massive tracks, Hot Wheels Unleashed should be right up toward the top of your list.                            
70	                                Hot Wheels Unleashed captures the spirit of the toy line in a veryappealing way and fans will find here a marvelous experience betweencollecting cars, customizing them, and making changes to the areasaround us. While the gameplay experience could use some tweaks when itcomes to its controls, and the high difficulty level will prove toughfor some players, it's easy to get completely absorbed by everythingthat Hot Wheels Unleashed does well.                            
70	                                As an overall package, Hot Wheels Unleashed is better than you might have expected. It does its license justice, and the racing action is more than competent. I’m not really a fan of how much luck plays a role, in terms of what cars you get from the Blind Boxes, in how well you’re able to tackle the campaign. If you get bad pulls, grinding for more chances can take forever. I also feel like some of the longer courses are a little too long, running for several minutes in some cases. Again, there is a big update coming very soon and likely more to come in the future, so some or all of these points could eventually be fixed. I can only review what is in front of me, and that’s a game that is quite good but with its fair share of flaws.                            
70	                                It remains an effective game, quite enjoyable and is without doubt the one that most faithfully respects the spirit of the famous brand, with that same nostalgic and passionate vision that we could have had ourselves, a few years earlier.                            
70	                                As it stands right now, Hot Wheels Unleashed is a fun racer whose fantastic selection of cars makes up for its relative lack of varied course environments. With updates and DLC it has the potential to become a brilliant mess of licensed properties in the way the best mash-up games are, but what’s here is a solid enough foundation to start from, even if it’s a little samey at launch.                            
100	                                Cruis’n Blast is arcade racing in its absolute best form imaginable, and if you want a racing game that leaves you grinning like an idiot the entire time you’re playing it, I couldn’t recommend it any more highly.                            
85	                                Crusin’ Blast is a new take on an old classic that doesn’t abandon its roots and will introduce itself to a new audience of young gamers, who I think will love it.                            
80	                                Cruis'n Blast is a wild time from top to bottom, and what it might lack in quantity, it makes up for in quality and replayability. If you like arcade racing, don't let this pass you by. It truly is a blast! [Issue #56 – November/December 2021, p. 73]                            
80	                                The racing in Cruis’n Blast truly reflects the game’s arcade roots, focusing on fun over-the-top thrills over any sort of realism. As long as you are okay with that, you’ll likely have as a good of a time with this Switch version as I did. I do wish there was support for online multiplayer as not everyone is going to have willing players in their vicinity, but I guess if a casual player was going to join in on any racing game without Mario in it, it might be this one. It’s colorful, silly, fast, and stylish. Raw Thrills did just about everything it could to make this home version the ultimate way to go Cruis’n, and it certainly does a good job of scratching an itch.                            
80	                                Cruis'n Blast is a very pleasant surprise for those who crave arcade racing over the simulation style. It nails the speed and the ease with which anyone can pick it up and play, thanks to a simplified control scheme and the easy AI difficulty in the early stages. Although the variety is superficial, there's a good variety of tracks here and plenty of oddball vehicles for players to unlock. One can argue that the game isn't deep, and dedicated players can get almost everything done in a day, but with pure arcade racing being gone for so long, you tend to forgive all of that when you're enjoying every moment.                            
80	                                Cruis’n Blast is an excellent return for the series and genre as a whole. The lack of online multiplayer hurts but there is a lot to enjoy for solo players and those who can play locally. Fantastic visuals and track set-pieces make this an engaging, fun time.                            
80	                                Cruis’n Blast is the most thrilling racing experience on Switch and the best arcade racer in years. It plays like a dream and offers up more control options than most arcade racers on the console. Its diverse lineup of vehicles, tracks and various track-related setpieces are tremendous and keep the player engaged from beginning to end. Other than the lack of online multiplayer, it’s hard to find something missing from the overall presentation given what the game is trying to be. The sound design is fantastic as well — with a fun soundtrack that’s breezy and easy on the ears.                            
80	                                If you’ve played previous Cruis’n games before, you know what you’re getting into. I had an absolute blast playing Cruis’n Blast and highly recommend it for any speed junkies that need a quick, fun fix on their Switch.                            
80	                                Cruis’n Blast is as arcade-y as an arcade racer can be. It has the high thrills and high stakes that are so over the top, but that’s the charm of the Cruis’n series. It doesn’t require so much setup to just get a few races in. If you are itching for wild thrills and quick rides, this is the perfect pickup.                            
80	                                Cruis’n Blast is a fantastic trip back to the past with some modern luxuries to round out the package. This is not a game for everyone. It can be maxed out in a day and the replay comes from the enjoyment of the races and tracks themselves. If you are into that though, you will be hard-pressed to find a more polished version of an arcade racing game to date. You can feel the love from Raw Thrills past work poured into this game and I hope it eventually makes its way onto other platforms at some point. Everyone should get a chance to experience the thrill of arcade racing in its finest form.                            
80	                                As long as you're willing to put up with some performance hits and the fact that there's no online multiplayer, Cruis'n Blast is a hugely entertaining arcade style racer with incredible set-pieces that has us crossing every possible body part in the hope that it's successful enough to encourage more of the same somewhere down the line.                            
75	                                Cruis’n Blast is great at what it does. However, there’s not much here beyond straightforward, arcade racing. While this was generally great for me, how much mileage someone will get out of it depends on how much they enjoy this relatively simple genre.                            
71	                                A completely crazy arcade game, ideal for those who want tightrope walkers, negligible for everyone else.                            
70	                                The arcade racing subgenre isn’t as buoyant as it once was with new examples few and far between so it’s always exciting when one does drift into view and delivers thrills in high doses. Cruis’n Blast is a truly wild ride of a game packed with plenty of fun and equally wild extras. It’s simple but electrifying and during a time where games are vying to offer season passes, realistic physics and always online experiences it’s truly welcome and refreshing to come across a game that just wants to be an old-school great time.                            
70	                                Cruis’n Blast is an endearingly earnest arcade racing time capsule, but it's also a very lean package that struggles to disguise its origins as a wafer-thin 2017 arcade cabinet.                            
70	                                Cruis’n Blast shoves players kicking and screaming to the time when the Dreamcast was king, racing was purely about things blowing up for no reason, and unicorns had great engine noises. And I love it for that.                            
70	                                For all its faults, Cruis'n Blast does a great job of capturing the style of its '90s predecessors. Throughout its various cups and in multiplayer, there's a lot of arcade fun that's a welcome break for anyone tired of Mario Kart 8. It's easy to wish that more time went into having a variety of modes rather than tracks that can feel too similar to stand out, and the graphics certainly aren't hiding the fact that this game was first released five years ago. Still, anyone looking to relive the days of Cruis'n USA will find a lot to like by taking a whirlwind tour of what Blast has to offer.                            
70	                                In short bursts, Cruis'n Blast is a solid racing entry that you'll likely have a lot of fun with, but its simplicity and lack of track variety reflect that these games are better intended for the arcade than as a home release. If you're looking for a more substantial racing experience, you'd be better off looking elsewhere.                            
70	                                I absolutely do miss those days. I can’t get on with realistic racing games, so I crave a steady diet of the stuff that Cruis’n Blast gives. At the same time, I normally rented racing games on the N64 and rarely bought them. The same would have held true for Cruis’n Blast. It’s too fleeting to really grab hold of my grey matter and make a home there. I had a lot of fun while it lasted, but now it’s time to return to the beige, carefully curated modernity.                            
70	                                There’s no doubt that Cruis’n Blast is going to serve a relatively niche audience, but that isn’t necessarily a bad thing. The sheer spectacle on display combined with vast opportunity for technical skill makes for an incredibly engaging arcade racing game that focuses on letting the player have pure, unfiltered fun. It’s a shame that there isn’t any form of online functionality to provide a little extra meaning to the experience, since that little extra motivation could’ve elevated Cruis’n Blast from a good game to a great game.                            
65	                                Arcade racers should be better represented on console and PC, with Cruis’n Blast ticking a lot of boxes for those who love this genre and wish that it wasn’t almost solely confined to arcade cabinets. There are few games that will pitch a unicorn in a race against a UFO, and such possibilities in Cruis’n Blast should be celebrated appropriately. However, performance problems, the absence of online multiplayer, and the lack of things to do for the solo player make for an altogether disappointing port, that nonetheless just about offers enough to warrant the attention of arcade racing fans.                            
65	                                Cruis'n Blast presents an arcade racing formula that's exciting at first but quickly wears thin due to its lack of challenge or need for skill. That being said, it can still be enjoyable for a few rounds of old-school racing entertainment with friends.                            
60	                                Cruis'n Blast for Nintendo Switch has been developed by a very small team, and for what it has achieved it is very admirable. It is an incredibly fun title for the first couple of hours, but it is lacking in any real depth to make it anything more than a fun weekend. Grabbing friends locally for a few races can be an absolute blast, but lacking any online modes whatsoever somewhat dampens the mood. The lack of modes is one thing, but the course variety is also another issue with most tracks being direct derivatives of the original five arcade ones. However, if a simple, easy to handle racer that has some astounding set pieces and outlandish vehicle choices is your type of thing, then Cruis'n Blast will definitely satisfy the urge.                            
60	                                I certainly had fun times in Cruisn’ Blast, particularly when my inner child was at the wheel, but my brain (which was never completely turned off) kept telling me that there are better racing games now. Cruisn’ Blast is full of nostalgia for a series that prefers the absurd above innovation or quality. There will be some voluntary and involuntary laughs here and there, as long as you are not bothered by short experiences full of Déjà vus and poor graphics.                            
60	                                All things considered, it took me a little over an hour or so to see just about everything that Cruis’n Blast has to offer. The Nintendo Switch racing scene has been dominated by Mario Kart and I feel like Cruis’n Blast had a chance to make a real case for bringing other classic Nintendo racers back into the scene. But if lackluster graphics and mediocre racing mechanics are all we’d get it might be better to leave our precious memories in the past. Cruis’n Blast isn’t unplayable though and would probably make an enjoyable experience for someone with kids or younger siblings. Everyone else should probably head to the arcade and hope they have a much more enjoyable arcade experience available to try out.                            
60	                                Cruis’n Blast focuses on style over substance, making the end result feel a bit hollow. Navigating a careening ferris wheel is the stuff action movies are made of, but there’s just not enough content here to justify picking up this home release over sinking a few bucks into the arcade version.                            
50	                                Overall, Cruis’n Blast is a simple and light-hearted arcade racer that, had it not been for the heavily scripted AI, would be a ton of fun to play. Unfortunately, this overrules all features in the game and leaves it feeling unfair and frustrating.                            
50	                                If you have friends to play with regularly, Cruis’n Blast can provide light arcade-style thrills. With over-the-top courses, a catchy soundtrack, and simple gameplay, there’s fun to be had. There’s just not enough content to justify it for anyone else, though, especially when basic features expected of the genre are missing.                             
45	                                An otherwise decent racing game, terrible AI choices, and rubber-banding cripple Cruis’n Blast. A real shame.                            
85	                                Reflection: Second Light is a perfect example of what a sequel should be. It takes the ideas put forward by the original and improves all of them. There's better exploration, better visuals, and, most importantly, much better character writing. The original was an average and forgettable JRPG. In contrast, Second Light is one of the best JRPGs released in recent memory.                            
81	                                Blue Reflection: Second Light builds upon many of the positive aspects while updating its combat system to be accessible for a broader JRPG fan audience. This is a step in the right direction that, while it may have some painful lows, also has some incredible highs that make for an overall great experience.                            
80	                                Blue Reflection Second Light is a great improvement over the original and a step in the right direction for the series. Almost every feature in the original has been refined. Although there are some interesting new ideas too, not all of them are implemented well, such as the new stealth system. Second Light is not a perfect game by any means, but it is a solid title to recommend for players that want something different from big-budget JRPGs and maybe prefer a game in a relaxed environment without trying to save the world all the time.                            
80	                                Blue Reflection: Second Light is a great follow-up and a much better PC conversion than the original Blue Reflection. While it has some annoyances in the overall gameplay, it is a great relaxing JRPG that is worth playing if you enjoy Gust's output.                            
75	                                Blue Reflection Second Light achieves what the past episode couldn't: telling an intriguing story with a cast of compelling characters. Its light RPG mechanics leave more space for character development, toning down fan service in favour of a plot that pushes forward reconnecting all the past entries, between videogames and animated series. A sugar coated coming of age story dedicated to anime girls and fans of the "majokko" narrative.                            
70	                                A slower-paced J-RPG but which offers a calm and soothing experience that will especially appeal to fans of Japanese productions.                             
60	                                The second entry in the Blue Reflection series, Blue Reflection: Second Light, is great for anyone looking for a casual RPG. The combat can be slow and repetitive, and the fanservice certainly leaves a uncomfortable feeling hanging over much of the game, but underneath all that is a solid RPG with a captivating mystery at its center.                            
91	                                Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy offers an excellent linear single player experience. With a great artistic design, a fun combat system and an outstanding script, this new title by Eidos Montreal will greatly satisfy any fan of narrative-focused games. Yes, some aspects like its animations are not up to par, but it doesn't impact its final result. We had a huge smile all the way through this fun game, enjoying its dialogues, its combat and sinking in its marvelous setting. And that's the most important thing to us.                             
90	                                Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy could’ve easily ended up being a lacklustre attempt at recreating what makes this group of oddballs so endearing to the Marvel community, but that’s not the case. The acting is top drawer, with a script in place that can make you laugh one minute and bring a tear to your eye the next.                            
90	                                Eidos Montreal has set new standards for the gaming industry when it comes to the design and script of companions in video games. While the gameplay is “simply ok”, the love and care that was given in the creation of this world, its wonderful soundtrack, its intricate accessibility settings, its lovely storyline and its simply amazing companions and their constant banter, make Guardians of the Galaxy an absolute must play for any gamer.                             
90	                                Guardians of the Galaxy looks good, sounds great, plays well, and above all else, is an authentic experience based on Marvel's misfits.                            
90	                                There’s no cash-in on the overall success of the MCU here, or on the Guardians of the Galaxy movies in a standalone sense. This is a pure videogame born from the paper and ink flesh of the comics before it, imagined as an interactive slice of the IP’s universe. And it absolutely works. The action-RPG lite approach was conclusively the right decision to make, which allows the game’s absolute strength: its story and characterisation, to truly stand out. This is a surprise hit for me, and one of the most enjoyable games from a written and performed perspective you’ll play this year.                            
90	                                Even with its faults that can easily be patched up, Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy is an absolute love letter to the property and one that any fan should be excited to play. Yes, the gameplay is excellent, but for this game, it's all about the characters. It's about small moments, big moments, and everything in between.                            
88	                                Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy gets back to the classic single-player formula, steering away from the hybrid attempt of Marvel’s Avengers and piecing together gameplay elements from Tomb Raider, Mass Effect and even Knights of the Old Republic to make a quite unique choral adventure. The player is asked to act like the team leader, taking decision and managing the resulting contrasts between the other members. The strength of differences is the big theme of the game, and Guardians of the galaxy is great in telling it both through narration and gameplay.                             
87	                                Guardians of the Galaxy is one of the funniest games of the year, in which a cleverly written and compelling story predominates and the - nothing more than fine - gameplay dominates. At first or into games that heavily emphasize the emotional journey of their main characters, you'll come to love this startling adventure through a unique Marvel universe. It helps enormously if you are a somewhat nostalgic thirty-something and of course have eagerly devoured a Marvel film or comic.                             
85	                                Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy proved to be a pleasant surprise and one of the best superhero titles around, with a compelling story and excellent characterization. There are still areas for improvement, especially in the gameplay that feels too familiar, but the Marvel license is definitely in good hands.                            
85	                                Marvel's Guardians of The Galaxy is a story driven title that feels great to play with and boasts awesome visuals.                            
85	                                I initially booted up Guardians of the Galaxy with tempered expectations but was surprised with how much fun I ended up having. Despite having a few setbacks, Guardians of the Galaxy is easily one of the best games of the year thanks to its fantastic story.                            
85	                                While it has one or two irksome flaws, Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy is, nonetheless, a fine solo experience, with characters that you'll enjoy spending time with, fast-paced combat, and an engaging original story.                             
85	                                As a fan of the Guardians’ comic books and movies, I thoroughly enjoyed Eidos-Montreal’s unique take on this supergroup. The nonstop character banter and nicely designed choices make this a journey worth taking, even if the gameplay takes a little too long to highlight the team’s true potential.                            
85	                                Guardians of the Galaxy is probably one of the biggest surprises for me this year. After the disappointment that was Avengers my hope for this game was low. Once I got into gear though I could not stop playing this one and I loved every minute of it.                            
84	                                With its exciting story and characters, the next-gen worthy visuals and especially the great sense of humor we can warmly recommend Eidos Montreal's Guardians of the Galaxy not just for fans of the franchise. Just the fights are a little bit too chaotic for getting a strong feeling of control on the battlefields in sum.                            
80	                                With its endearing characters and effective humor, Guardians of the Galaxy is one of the pleasant surprises of the end of the year, which is obviously aimed at a very large audience. Behind this careful writing, we feel a deep love on the part of the developers of Eidos Montreal for its marginalized space. And if the adventure is not as epic as we hoped, the journey is nonetheless pleasant with its moments of complicity and the many choices offered which reinforce the player's involvement. A truly attractive journey, in particular thanks to an efficient and fluid combat system which nevertheless shows its limits at the end of the game and against the bosses. Finally, it is more on its visual part that the title can divide. If we find on the one hand original environments and neat character models, we also note the presence of less convincing facial animations in places and sometimes less fine landscapes. It is nonetheless a gripping adventure alongside the galaxy's greatest magnificent losers that has plenty to please MCU fans.                             
80	                                And that can be said of Guardians of the Galaxy in a multitude of ways. As chaotic as it gets and despite any faults players may have with it, it’s hard not to feel like Star-Lord himself at the end of the game. For a game with such a heavy focus on narrative and choices, player investment is crucial, and Guardians of the Galaxy delivers tenfold.                             
80	                                By dodging the eager game-as-service guff, Guardians of the Galaxy can focus on being something more compelling - even if you won’t play it for as long. For its ten-plus hour runtime, you’ll enjoy a thrilling, gripping, funny, and surprisingly heartfelt adventure. The game built around that narrative framework isn’t earth shattering - but it is enough scaffolding to allow the story to shine. You have to understand what Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy is going into - but if you do, one of the finest narrative games of the year awaits. Switch your brain off, give yourself over to its story, and you’ll find much to enjoy.                            
80	                                While the mechanics at times can be frustrating, Guardians of the Galaxy is a really enjoyable experience that I would recommend to a wide audience: for fans of all things Marvel, action games, and stories that dare to go that step further in relating a compelling fantasy to hugely relevant real-world matters.                            
80	                                Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy perfectly balances having a brand new narrative surrounding the misfit team of heroes whilst maintaining their classic characteristics from the Marvel universe. However, I was left wanting more in terms of combat and I still want to play as Groot. Overall, it’s a great game for new and old Marvel fans alike that breathes new life into the now-recognisable characters. Hopefully, Edios-Montréal and Square Enix will consider doing a second game, as there’s so much more of the Galaxy to explore.                            
80	                                Despite some issues with bugs and shooting that could use a little more weight behind it, Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy tells a fantastic story that kept me glued to my seat until the very end. An excellent voice cast, killer 80s soundtrack, and strategic combat sweetened the deal. Anyone looking for a fun action game should consider checking it out, and for fans of the Guardians, this is an absolute must-play.                            
78	                                Even with its flaws, Guardians of the Galaxy is a great adventure we’ve had a lot of fun with, thanks to its impressive art design, its great narrative and chemistry between the clumsiest heroes in the galaxy.                            
70	                                Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy is like a tie-in of 15 year ago with corridors, forced paths to follow and little arenas in which you must fight enemies in the same way. Marvel's fan will adore references, easter eggs and cameos, but it's not enough to make this project shine like a new star in the galaxy.                            
70	                                Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy was a surprising experience. Though the game still has some bugs, and a few undesirable features, it comes packed with in-depth characters and an extensive storyline. If you have time to go for a very long virtual walk, this might be the game for you.                            
95	                                Hot Wheels Unleashed is a surprisingly good racing game that brings your childhood imagination to life while offering you endless creative options for customising your toy racers and designing your own tracks. No matter your age there is tons to love here!                            
95	                                Hot Wheels Unleashed is an instant classic, a licensed game with AAA production values that never stops delivering thrills. With enough content and features to satisfy the most demanding audience, Hot Wheels focus on razor sharp arcade racing delivers exactly what fans want – tons of cool cars, wild tracks, and collectable, customizable fun. Our highest recommendation.                            
90	                                The simple, pick-up-and-play racing action keeps things tame so anyone can pick one of the several rides and zoom down the masterfully crafted tracks without any fuss and little learning curve. With only a few misgivings to work on as of this review, Hot Wheels Unleashed has first place already in the bag, and I’m eager to see it continue succeeding down the line.                            
85	                                I enjoyed Hot Wheels Unleashed a lot more than I expected to, and it'll likely be my go-to pick-up-and-play racer for the foreseeable future. The game plays well, looks great, and has enough customization options to keep things fresh.                            
80	                                Hot Wheels Unleashed impressed me on basically every marker. It looks terrific, it feels great, and the track design is extremely well done. I kind of hate the blind box approach of unlocking cars, but that’s a small complaint when getting my wheels on the track is always a delight.                            
78	                                Hot Wheels Unleashed is an enjoyable arcade racer with deep customization and great presentation, let down by a lack of modes to play.                            
77	                                Despite some aspects of the game feel more improvable than others, Hot Wheels Unleashed is without a doubt the best game ever made about the toy cars made by Mattel.                            
77	                                Although driving is super fun, the design of the career mode feels boring and samey after the first hour. Hopefully the multiplayer will be able to lend the game some more longevity.                            
75	                                Pure arcade racing fun that properly captures the charm of the HotWheels brand. Track editor shortcomings and an expensive Day-One DLC arehowever bothersome.                            
75	                                Hot Wheels Unleashed is a competent enough racer, but lacks anything to make it unique compared to previous games. It’s generally very bland, relies on loot boxes, and the AI rubber bands constantly.                            
75	                                With Hot Wheels Unleashed, the Mattel brand succeeds in its return to video games with a dynamic title, easy to handle, fluid and really fun. Everything breathes the Hot Wheels spirit and that's good. Despite a feeling of repetitiveness linked to the use of only 5 environments, it contains a lot of good ideas and often gives you a good feeling, especially during the boss races. We would have liked a less redundant soundtrack and a more advanced story mode, but it still manages to do well. As for the collectors, they will be delighted to chase the rare pearl, even if the surprise box option and its random dimension are highly debatable.                            
70	                                Hot Wheels Unleashed could have been such a great game, but wasted his potential. Basically, it’s a fun arcade racer with an interesting setting which it barely uses in interesting ways. Also, the multiplayer is broken. Nevertheless, despite its flaws, Hot Wheels Unleashed is a fun racing game. Just don’t expect anything extraordinary.                            
70	                                The track editor is brilliant, enabling people to go delirious with imagination, though sadly, sharing these creations is hindered by the poor UI and filtering options. I also dislike the concept behind blind boxes, it is just not a good way to unlock more cars, too many dupes for it to be anything other than frustrating. Apart from those cons, I have good words for Hot Wheels Unleashed. This is a solid recommendation for anyone who enjoys arcade racers, especially ones that go more for skill and speed over the randomness of power-ups.                            
70	                                It remains an effective game, quite enjoyable and is without doubt the one that most faithfully respects the spirit of the famous brand, with that same nostalgic and passionate vision that we could have had ourselves, a few years earlier.                            
65	                                Hot Wheels Unleashed has a lot of good concepts and ideas that are sullied by awkward execution and weird design choices. Its physics could use some more fine-tuning, and its AI needs to be rebalanced, along with a revamped track builder. Yet, there's still some glimmer to its toy car shine.                            
65	                                Hot Wheels Unleashed is a pure arcade racer. Drift on corners, push boost on straights, be first on the finish line – these are the principles. It is as simple as it is fun. With great sense of speed, fierce competitors, and twisted track designs, races are dynamic, vigorous, and exciting… At least during the first three hours.                            
90	                                Overall, this Switch version stands up right next to the other versions of Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot, and I was pleasantly surprised by it. While some things could be better in the game as a whole it doesn’t deter from the overall enjoyment of the story of Dragon Ball. I personally would like to have seen this one start all the way back in Dragon Ball when we first meet everyone, which would truly be a Kakarot story.                             
90	                                Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot has wonderful characters, an amazing story, and makes me incredibly nostalgic. I would wholeheartedly recommend this title to anyone who asks about it. Oh boy, I just really love Dragon Ball Z.                            
86	                                Overall, Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot is a highly entertaining game that’s faithful to the franchise. It accurately depicts the nostalgic events of the series’ earlier stories, and the gameplay engages the player while doing so.                            
85	                                DBZ: Kakarot + A New Power Awakens Set is packed full of epic fights, side quests, and a good amount of free DLC. The game looks and plays great on the Switch. I highly recommend it for fans of the series.                            
80	                                The full, compact story, an equally complete cast of memorable characters and an abundance of opportunities to unleash our Kamehameha, Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot is a title that players should not miss. Despite some inconsistencies in gameplay and poor development decisions, Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot brings forth the nostalgia and glory of Goku’s saga, leaving only a sweet sense behind.                             
80	                                Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot + A New Power Awakens Set is a great title that combines RPG, action and adventure with tons of content that will give us dozens of hours of fun. If you are a fan of Dragon Ball you cannot miss it.                            
80	                                Sadly, I cannot claim that Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot + A New Power Awakens Set is the complete experience. But for the same price as the base game on any other console, the Switch version is definitely the way to go for new players. Anyone who already owns the base game and DLC on other systems might only be interested for portability purposes. Any Dragon Ball Z fan, who has not played Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot, need to do themselves a favor and play this strange hybrid of cinematic storytelling, 3D fighting game aerial combat, JRPG mechanics, and open world exploration.                            
80	                                Dragon Ball fans can enjoy now Kakarot on Switch with a solid version that also adds some additional content.                            
80	                                Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot on Switch is a stunningly uncompromised port of last year’s massive RPG. It looks and runs fantastically, while also including all three DLC chapters in a perfectly portable package.                            
80	                                Overall, Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot + A New Power Awakens Set is a solid enough port of one of the more enjoyable Dragon Ball games. It's not quite as smooth or shiny as its bigger brothers, but it does the job well enough and has the advantage of being portable. The added DLCs are nice bonus content, but only Trunk's story stands well enough on its own. Fans of the franchise who haven't yet played Kakarot will find the Switch version a perfectly fun experience. Just don't be surprised when you're only playing the title character for short periods of time.                            
80	                                Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot on Switch delivers the same high action available on other platforms at the cost of some visual graphics. Frame rate is crucial to the experience, and if things have to get a little out of focus to keep the fights moving, so be it. There’s so much to enjoy about this game, and the Switch is a fine place to experience all the stories, exploration, and intense battles that it has to offer.                            
80	                                Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot was a gorgeous game on other platforms and one of the better Dragon Ball games when it launched a little while ago. It's great to see it translate so well to Nintendo's hybrid system in a better-than-expected conversion that includes new features, and some DLC right from the get go.                            
78	                                Dragon Ball Z Kakarot comes to Switch with all its pros and cons and the free DLC does not add much in terms of quality or longevity.                            
77	                                CyberConnect2 knows how to develop and port games, no question about that. It may not run at 60fps, but this pocket-sized version of Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot is still able to live up to its counterparts on other platforms. A pity that the last DLC was not included, considering it would have made the game even more appealing.                            
75	                                In the epic battle between the forces of bad Switch ports and great Switch ports, Goku and his friends take the size of the good guys, with this game being a great port of a good game with loads of extra content and good performance on Nintendo's small hybrid console.                            
75	                                The technical limits of Nintendo Switch are well known, yet Kakarot's aura expands from second to second even on the hybrid machine of the Kyoko House, which in spite of the predictions has in fact been able to guarantee us an always fluid experience and a shot of ' remarkable eye.                            
74	                                Although it is the weakest choice in terms of graphics among the platforms, it has the advantage of experiencing the Dragon Ball Z adventure on a portable console. Anime lovers should not miss it.                            
70	                                While its game world is not as fully explored as in other JRPGs, what wehave here is a real work of fan service, topped off with praiseworthygraphics and art style, and a fantastic audio work. All this might notbe enough to convince those who are not keen on Dragon Ball, but itsfans will be delighted with Kakarot.                            
70	                                Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot might not do much more than retelling the story of Dragon Ball, but it does that well enough that existing fans will find joy in exploring the world and fighting iconic villains from the franchise. Despite the lack of depth to its combat and a minor internet-based technical inconvenience to work around, the game saves itself by expanding on the already massive amount of Dragon Ball lore available and giving fans the slice-of-life moments we've so sorely needed. Non-fans won't find much to love here, but it's a more than serviceable retelling of an iconic story.                            
70	                                For people that are already big fans of Dragon Ball Z, as a whole, Kakarot has some value as a walk down memory lane and a way to re-experience the show in an entirely different manner. However, if you’re not already a big fan of Goku and Co’s adventures, Kakarot sadly has absolutely nothing for you. Without the nostalgia factor this game ends up being a slow slog of samey gameplay that likely won’t keep your attention for very long.                            
70	                                Despite some issues here and there, Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot is a worthwhile investment for fans of the series on Nintendo Switch.                            
70	                                Quotation forthcoming.                            
60	                                Someone's bound to get a DBZ action/adventure game right one of these days, but unfortunately this one's a few Dragon Balls short of summoning Shenron, if you know what I mean. [Issue #56 – November/December 2021, p. 68]                            
90	                                WarioWare: Get It Together! is a WAH-nderful addition to the WarioWare series. Between the microgames themselves, the quirky humor, and the new mechanic featuring all of Wario's friends, this game is a gift to fans of the series. However, not all playable characters are equally useful, and not every multiplayer mode will dazzle you.                            
90	                                If you've got a Nintendo Switch and friend, or four friends, to play Wario's latest foray into madness with, you're in for a whole lot of confusion and fun as the game peels open like a bulb of garlic. There is almost no one I would not recommend WarioWare: Get It Together! to, except maybe my grandmother. And your grandmother, too, probably. Everyone else? It's a heck of a lot of fun, and well-worth adding to and multiplayer Switch library.                            
90	                                With a ton of content and a massive variety of ways to play, WarioWare: Get It Together! is a solid purchase for any Switch owner looking for a blissful and somewhat manic distraction from day-to-day life.                            
90	                                WarioWare: Get It Together! proves there’s plenty more fun left in the tank for his wonderfully zany series. Playing as the characters themselves is an unexpected direction but one that works brilliantly while the introduction of co-operative play creates an entirely new and exciting experience that I hope we see more of. WarioWare: Get It Together! once more delivers an experience unlike anything else out there, let’s just hope we don’t have to wait another ten years for the next.                            
90	                                It leans into its own ridiculousness to deliver a multiplayer experience that feels unique to the series and a single-player experience that has plenty of fun reasons to return even after you beat Story Mode.                            
90	                                WarioWare: Get It Together! is a triumphant Switch debut for the subversive series that makes some daring changes to core gameplay, resulting in the best entry in the franchise to date. With a generous roster of playable characters, lots of solo and multiplayer modes to dig into, and stages that cleverly adapt to your choices on the fly, this is a superb compilation of hilarious microgames that delivers more ways to play than ever before. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll dodge bird droppings on a skateboard. So grab a few friends or family members, break out the controllers, and gather round the TV — WarioWare: Get It Together! is essential stuff.                            
90	                                WarioWare is the latest in a long line of classic Nintendo franchises that has well and truly found its groove again on Switch. Get It Together! is gloriously silly, consistently puerile, and heaps of fun. I wouldn't have it any other way.                            
89	                                The game is a very welcome sequel of the franchise that can act like a "remake" of the first titles. With your new microgames, it keeps the essence of "fast-fun pills", but with an excellent local multiplayer twist. The lack in use of the Switch functionalities, such as touch screen or gyro-controls is what remained to Get it Together be a definitive version of the series. But the new post-game modes are at least a try to cover it, ensuring that the player will be much more addicted with Get it Together than a lot of past games.                            
87	                                WarioWare: Get It Together! is one of the funniest games that you will find on Nintendo Switch this year. Wario's crew is back full of good surprises, like lots of interesting microgames and a nice variety of modes to play alone or with a friend.                            
85	                                WarioWare: Get It Together! is short but it’s an absolute blast to play and will keep you hooked with everything it throws at you. The single-play story can beaten quickly but the replay value is in the different characters and figuring out how they handle each puzzle. The graphics are wild and fun, the controls are really solid, and the wealth of multiplayer options make this a blast for multiplayer couch sessions.                            
85	                                WarioWare: Get It Together! is a brilliant return to the micro game formula. The directly use of characters inside the game changes in a pretty good way how do you approach each challenge that the games throws.                            
85	                                Fun, challenging, and varied. This is how I would define WarioWare: Get It Together!, Nintendo's new title for the hybrid console. I admit that it can be a bit of a disappointment to those players looking for depth, mainly because WarioWare is pretty straightforward, but this kind of Free Guy style in video games is definitely something that has enchanted me.                            
85	                                Whether you just want to have a good time with fast and crazy mini-games, or you want to perform by completing it at 100% with the highest scores, Wario Ware Get It Together is undeniably the best opus in the series. While it's a shame to see no touchpad games on Switch, the new opus does offer some good new features and functionality.                            
85	                                With references that will make long-time Nintendo fans squeal, WarioWare: Get it Together has deeper gameplay and more longevity than you’d expect. You’ll love it or hate it, however, depending on whether you like the changes or not.                            
83	                                WarioWare: Get It Together is as random and frantic as you would expect a character-driven entry in the long-running series to be. However, you may not expect just how fun it is to play with a friend and that's where its gameplay shines brightest.                            
83	                                WarioWare Get it Together! it's the usual crazy, fun and entertaining experience. The twist of the characters moves and attacks makes the gameplay even more fresh.                            
80	                                A squad-based WarioWare? It's better than could have anticipated. [Issue#364, p.122]                            
80	                                An excellent addition to the series with the introduction of 20 playable characters, emphasis on co-op and multiplayer, and tons of content. If only the online was beefier.                            
80	                                WarioWare has traditionally been one of the more bizarre entries in the Nintendo catalog, but it has always been a welcome one. And although the crazy microgame approach won’t appeal to everyone, WarioWare: Get It Together! freshens up the approach just enough to make sure longtime fans will want to check it out.                            
80	                                This crazy bundle of more than 200 micro-games offers a truly bonkers visual mix and furious tempo. It’s not very good in singleplayer but if you’re looking for something to spice up your house party, this might just be your best bet.                            
80	                                While perhaps sacrificing a little of the series’ identity, WarioWare: Get it Together! goes in a bold new direction on Switch that largely pays off. It’s great, clean, wacky fun.                            
80	                                Managing constant chaos has always been a core tenet of the WarioWare experience, and in doubling down on the randomness of its microgames, the series has at last gotten its shtick together.                            
80	                                WarioWare makes a welcome return, providing the familiar fast-paced microgames action that fans will be accustomed to. Filled with quirky charm, this Switch entry doesn't disappoint. The new character gimmick, however, does get in the way slightly despite adding a neat twist to some of the microgames.                            
80	                                It's rare for a long-running series to disappear for a decade, come back with some fairly dramatic changes, and still come away on top. Any one of these factors would be a death-knell for a worser series, so the fact that this title can balance all of them at once is truly impressive. WarioWare: Get it Together may not seem ambitious at a glance, but at a closer look, the scope is genuinely admirable. Somehow, Intelligent Systems was able to create 200+ microgames that could each be played by 19 characters, without any of these elements feeling bloated or ancillary. Time will tell if this installment remains as beloved as its cult-classic counterparts, but even after one whole week, Cubed3 is not ready to put the game down just yet. Especially when there's still some high scores that need beating!                            
80	                                Despite some minor issues, WarioWare has never been better, and the joy of experimentation, fantastic presentation, and a wealth of options and unlockables, means there’s a veritable treasure trove that fans of the series will happily plunder for months.                            
80	                                Get It Together! lives up to the premise established by its predecessors, offering changes that feel fresh, while still retaining the bizarre aesthetic and fast-paced fun in its mini-games that defines the series.                            
80	                                WarioWare: Get It Together, despite its rather short campaign, features over 200 incredibly funny, absurd, and downright creative microgames for players to complete. You’ll find yourself laughing your way through the experience, fighting with your friends over who failed a game, and savoring your triumphs over the late game’s harder challenges. The addition of the Emporium, Break Room, Missions, Play-O-Pedia, and Wario Cup are nice and will keep the game fresh for many players well after they complete the story, but a few players may not enjoy the grind to unlock all the Prezzies available. As it stands, WarioWare: Get It Together is a great, though short-lived, game – perfect for a night in with a friend.                            
80	                                This is a game I expect to go back to regularly throughout the life of the Switch. But when I do, it probably won’t be for the multiplayer. Those modes are fine, but cooperative play adds a bit too much stress. But as a classic WarioWare, Get It Together shines.                            
80	                                Hectic fun that it’s hard to stop playing.                            
80	                                The transient nature of the microgame concept means WarioWare: Get It Together, isn’t the kind of thing you’d want to pull out for a long haul, but for short bursts of pure, chaotic delight—especially with friends—you can’t go wrong. It’s surprising that it’s taken this long for Wario and his crew to become playable characters in their own game, but their unique abilities (and flaws) are a welcome twist on the frantic nature of WarioWare‘s rapid-fire minigames.                            
80	                                WarioWare: Get It Together! isn’t the best game in the series, but the latest from Wario’s video game company is still a delight. With tons of variety, this is the sort of game I can see myself popping into for a quick session regularly for years to come. If you have friends to play with, this is an easy recommendation. Even without those, there’s plenty of variety to keep players coming back until Wario’s next creation is ready to go.                            
80	                                WarioWare: Get it Together! is a very fun game from the moment you pick it up. It has a generous selection of over 200 micro games to sink your time into. Pair that with the various playstyles of the characters, and you have yourself a lot more than just a one and done game.                            
80	                                This is a great addition to the series, with wonderful micro-games, excellent co-op mini games and a lot to unlock in-game. The additional cast of characters can be a mixed bag, but overall this is a fine game.                            
80	                                Thankfully, there is enough in WarioWare: Get It Together to keep fans plugging away at high scores and microgame mastery. The character movement can make some of the games far too simplistic when compared to the timing-based gameplay of past series entries and in the similar Rhythm Heaven series. However, the trade-off in pure variety makes for microgames that keep players on their toes for far longer, and anything that keeps the WarioWare train going is a good thing. Even after excising the baffling online mode, this is the same great WarioWare experience on a platform that lets players bring it to the couch and share Wario's distinctive brand of gaming with friends and family.                            
80	                                WarioWare: Get It Together! is another thoroughly entertaining entry into this wacky series. The introduction of multiple different playable characters has its pros and cons, but once over the initial adjustment period, their addition makes for plenty of replayability, refreshing challenges and the special blend of multiplayer chaos only Wario can provide. It’s not the strongest WarioWare game overall, but it’s another quality party option for your Switch collection.                             
80	                                WarioWare: Get It Together promises great fun with its wide range of characters and hundreds of mini-games. Don't forget to bring your friends for maximum fun.                            
80	                                It’s not quite enough to propel the game to the must-have status of some previous WarioWare titles, but there’s still plenty here to like.                            
80	                                WarioWare: Get It Together! is a fantastic game that is nothing like anything currently on the Switch. Due to this, the game is an essential title for anyone who enjoys local multiplayer madness. Bubbling with content, you will have plenty to do even after completing the relatively short campaign. With a range of modes, there are tons of options to accommodate up to 4-players in cooperative or competitive mayhem. Although lacking online multiplayer, this is a rock-solid title that manages to be accessible, frustrating, and fun at the same time.                            
80	                                WarioWare: Get It Together is absolutely full of content that ranges from the ridiculous to the sublime and marks the franchise’s strongest entry yet. Additional playable characters increase the chaos, while a huge number of microgames and modes are a great way to spend the upcoming Autumn nights with friends. While we’d have liked more in the way of online functionality, Wario is definitely back – and better than ever.                            
80	                                WarioWare: Get it Together is a clever game: true to itself but incredibly fresh thanks to a simple yet ingenious intuition that revolutionises the axioms of the series without distorting it. It won't last long for lone players aiming solely for the end credits, but those with friends to challenge or collaborate with will find it a great party game.                            
80	                                WarioWare: Get It Together! will give you tons of fun in short bursts. What's more, it looks great during 4-player sessions. If you have only a minute or two to turn a boring party into a cool one - the new WarioWare is your best bet.                            
80	                                Nearly two decades after its first entry, the WarioWare series still knows how to keep things feeling fresh, but the series’ chaotic bombardment of micro-games is as addictive as ever. While the experience might not be as rich as say The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild or Super Mario Odyssey, Get it Together! is still tons of fun to play.                            
80	                                WarioWare: Get It Together! could be the best entry in the series: it has a lot of options, characters, game and modes. It has only one, great problem: differently from its predecessors, it's too complex to be played by casual gamers.                            
80	                                WarioWare has absurdity at its heart. And the speed of the game, plus its generous amount of wildly differing micro games, make it a fun title to play over and over with pals. In solo gameplay I suspect the dazzle will wane once you’ve tried all the micro games a couple of times. That’ll take less time than you think as they’re so frenetic and over so quickly. But Nintendo has done another good job here giving players a unique new game that the Switch hasn’t seen before. Well worth a look.                            
80	                                WarioWare: Get it together! it is fresh, intense and does not give respite. An ideal option to enjoy, especially in company, crazy tests that are far from the traditional. Although your Story Mode can be completed in just one afternoon, you have many options to play in company.                            
80	                                For the most part, the new character-based approach is a welcome addition to the WarioWare blueprint. The characters themselves are differentiated and expressive, and mechanically they make the traditional microgame challenges that much more engaging. The WarioWare series has been fertile ground for Nintendo to experiment with concepts like touchscreen capabilities in Touched or accelerometer-based motion in Twisted, which makes Get It Together's platforming riffs a little more traditional than usual. But that also makes it less reliant on a gimmick, and that's a change for the better.                            
80	                                With a fresh focus on unique characters and multiplayer mayhem, WarioWare: Get It Together finds room for even more creativity in an already one-of-a-kind series.                            
80	                                WarioWare: Get It Together is unabashedly Nintendo, fulfilling its mission statement to the letter with alarming precision, but also not rocking the boat very much at all. The game’s one big change - controlling a cast of characters - didn’t turn out to be that big of a deal after all. The result is a wonderfully infectious game to play alone - while it lasts - but the true value of the package will be in playing it with others.                             
80	                                Mad, funny guy Wario. It's new adventure is a game, inside a game made of over 200 other crazy mini-games... with multiple characters and modes. You can't miss it.                            
80	                                WarioWare is back at square one with a brand new, funny chapter that re-elaborates the original concept, with a multi-player and multi-characters twist.                            
80	                                WarioWare: Get It Together! gets back to basics. It throws out the controller gimmicks of old, but brings in the added layer of quirky character abilities that brilliantly manage to work with every single one of the moreish microgame mayhem that this series is so well known for. Oh, and it makes for a great party game too!                            
80	                                We have had a great time with Get it Together!, a new entry that manages to successfully refresh the series while keeping it true to itself.                            
80	                                There is chaos and then there is WarioWare. It has been years since the franchise brought out its latest offering, but that is all changing in 2021. WarioWare is back and better than ever thanks to its Nintendo Switch debut. And if you thought Wario's gang couldn't get wackier, you thought wrong.                            
78	                                WarioWare: Get It Together's lively visuals are temporarily engaging, but this candy shell has a hollow center; like any sugary snack, the experience doesn't stick with you. As soon as I'd wrapped Get It Together's brief single-player campaign, I was content to move onto something else. These microgames are a nice treat if you're in an eccentric mood, but these miniature experiences only offer short-lived joy.                            
76	                                There are plenty of unusual or downright bizarre situations in Get It Together microgames: for example, you might need to shave the armpits of a statue of Zeus when all you have is a robo-singer. But every game lasts only a few seconds, so no matter how weird it is, it never outstays its welcome. [Issue#255, p.64]                            
75	                                If you're looking to get the most enjoyment out of this title, it's best to play with family or invite a bunch of friends over – it's a solid collection for get-togethers, but lacking in the solo play department. [Issue #56 – November/December 2021, p. 74]                            
75	                                WarioWare returns while maintaining its trademark quality standards, but without reaching the heights of excellence of previous entries. The addition of multiple characters with their own mechanics is a welcome addition, adding unpredictability and preventing memorising micro-games from ruining the challenge in the long run. Every run is different. However, neither the selection of microgames nor the final bosses are as brilliant as they once were, and the difficulty is noticeably reduced. The multiplayer mode is its greatest asset, multiplying the hours ad infinitum; coupled with online leaderboards. And again, it is a lesson on how to combine fun without time to think. Irreverence for flag.                             
75	                                WarioWare: Get It Together! provides casual fun with countless microgames, which nevertheless run out of steam in the long term.                            
75	                                WarioWare: Get It Together! knows how to give a fresh twist to the now well-known microgame series with a new way of controlling. The enormous amount of microgames are again quite bizarre, although not every microgame is equally successful. Especially in multiplayer, the story mode is very entertaining, which makes it a shame that it only supports two players.                            
75	                                Perhaps its beauty, however, is right there, in its hit & run irreverence like the sudden appearance of a colorful artificial fire in the shape of poop.                            
75	                                I'm grateful that another Wario game even exists, and WarioWare: Get It Together! is going to be a hit for a lot of people who are already dedicated to this special brand of weird.                            
73	                                WarioWare: Get it Together! retains its easy to pick up and hard to master nature while adding a bit of a challenging element through its newly implemented characters. However, this can work against it as the layer of complexity may alienate fans who want to optimize their performance because of the way some characters are designed.                             
72	                                Wario Ware: Get it together delivers a nice bunch of characters within fast paced and creative mini games and challenges. But especially for solo players the game will run out of air in just a few hours. Even with co-op and competitive modes included, the game does not offer long term fun like Super Smash Bros. Ultimate or funracer king Mario Kart 8 do.                            
70	                                The WarioWare series finally lands on the Nintendo Switch and not amoment too soon. Get It Together! brings us a collection of 200 newmicrogames that feature everything that made the other WarioWare gamesmemorable, this time with an additional story mode as well as a seriesof weekly online challenges that will reward the players. Zany, fun andlong-lasting, WarioWare: Get It Together! is an absolute blast, whetheron solo or with friends.                            
70	                                WarioWare: Get It Together offers a twist to the renowned wacky series of fast and tricky mini games. This time around, you will be controlling many of the well known characters the series has spawned over the years, with each and every single one of them being unique when it comes to the way you control them. Some aspects of the game seem redundant and misplaced, but the meat of the game still is as enjoyable and funny as the series has always been.                            
70	                                WarioWare: Get It Together! is a fast-paced game whose latest changes have created a ton of replay value. Challenge your brain, put your reaction time to the test and get some friends together for some classic fun with this legendary Nintendo character.                            
70	                                Get It Together is a valuable addition and features several of the best minigames of the WarioWare franchise. However, being forced to switch characters with different abilities can be annoying and sometimes success depends more on luck than your expertise.                            
70	                                WarioWare: Get It Together! is a great party game that will be especially entertaining for co-op players. Some of the game modes force you to play certain characters, but those can be easily avoided if you don't enjoy them.                            
70	                                WarioWare: Get it Together! gracefully continues the series tradition by mixing brash presentation with great arcade collidoscope of ideas that feels extremely fun both at loud parties or all alone by yourself.                            
70	                                WarioWare: Get it Together! has some of the best microgames in the series, all of which carry on the zany heart of the WarioWare franchise. The multiplayer modes and weekly challenges add a lot of replayability, making it great for killing a few minutes with friends. But when it comes to adding its own twist to the series, Get it Together‘s constant switching out of characters just doesn’t mesh well with the WarioWare formula that we know and love. That, along with the disappointing lack of much of the comedic dialogue we’ve seen from previous games, hold it back from being Wario’s best. But it still promises a fun time whenever you have a few minutes to spare.                            
70	                                It's all fun and games until it stop because the game is just so short. Wario Ware: Get it Together! is a good new entry for newcomers, and just enough to calm down the fans, but let's not wait another 15 years for the next one, please?                            
70	                                Still, as a multiplayer romp, WarioWare: Get It Together is a great game to bust out and if you're pressed on time, that's even better! Just don't expect this to be your go-to game for nights in with your buddies.                            
70	                                Ultimately? WarioWare: Get It Together! is a fine enough game, if you come in with the proper expectations. It’s full of whimsy. The character gimmick is fun. It shines when you play with a local pal. But its limitations mark a trend for Nintendo. It appears that the publisher’s response to rising development costs is to cut corners on its lesser-selling franchises. With Get It Together! and Mario Golf: Super Rush both feeling a bit half-baked, we worry that the company’s tradition of over-delivering in scope and extras might increasingly be a memory.                            
70	                                WarioWare: Get It Together! is exactly what fans of the series will be expecting. It’s a brand new mix on the familiar formula that allows players to try out brand new microgames in fully new ways in addition to teaming up with a friend if they so desire to challenge and compete with one another. WarioWare at its core is very much a title for people who love competition and getting the top score, and doesn’t have as much to do for those who don’t have a friend to play with or want to get a bigger number over the others, but it’s still fun to pick up and enjoy all it has to offer along the way. It would be nice if we’d seen a few old modes return from previous titles, but a great amount has been added that makes it feel like an entirely new experience mixed in with old concepts. There’s nothing quite like WarioWare, and it’s great to have Get It Together! on Switch as the latest entry in the crazy series that keeps on delivering.                            
70	                                The same weird microgame madness as usual. But the new character concept is not a good fit. There definitely is some party fun to be found, but it doesn't last too long.                             
70	                                I love WarioWare: Get it Together for bringing this charming series back into the limelight. It introduces a bunch of excellent new microgames and a huge selection of returning characters I was so happy to see, yet the short campaign and lacking amount of extras can make the overall package feel underwhelming. Unless you’ve loved the series for decades, this one might be hard to recommend until the game is subject to a discount or two.                            
70	                                WarioWare: Get It Together! is an absurd delight, testing your ability to think quickly and adapt on the fly in a series of ever-escalating microgames. That tried-and-true formula is still a lot of fun here, looking better than ever and introducing unique characters that can either bring interesting twists or mechanical frustration to familiar games depending on who you’re using. It’s a shame that Get It Together!’s multiplayer options somewhat drop the ball though, enough for an evening or two of laugh-out-loud fun with friends but lacking the staying power for many more beyond that.                            
70	                                Despite a certain lack of inspiration, the WarioWare company keeps having some ambition, potentially less lucrative than its greedy owner's. Thus Get It Together! favors efficiency over quantity with microgames by focusing on gameplay, customized for each - henceforth playable - character in order to provide different ways to play, yet in teams. The Switch's technological functions are therefore limited to the detachable controllers, a not so audacious approach for the franchise, contrary to the choice of such heterogeneous protagonists, reflecting the decidedly varied modes. Whether innovative or harebrained, this convivial evolution surely follows Wario's philosophy as a gambler.                            
70	                                I did hope for a little bit more from this Switch title; WarioWare: Gold for the 3DS seemed to have better value with 100 more microgames, full voice acting, and a lower price tag. The Switch game just feels like it's missing something. However, WarioWare: Get It Together! is simply fun. It's an entertaining game to play in short bursts when you have some downtime or when you're in the mood for something a little zanier.                            
65	                                The strong point of this WarioWare is ultimately its solo.                            
61	                                Is he nice again, this WarioWare? Yes, he is, but after eight previous WarioWare games, the surprise or feeling of playing something truly new has evaporated. And for a full priced game, the fun is just over too quickly.                             
60	                                WarioWare's back with an initially enjoyable title filled to the brim with minigames. After a couple of hours, however, you'll notice that this new iteration doesn't really have a lot to offer. Boring bossfights and a lack of minigame variation make for an ultimately unworthy addition to the franchise.                            
60	                                At best, WarioWare: Get It Together! is a welcome return of Nintendo’s subversive anti-hero in a series that delights in being weird, hilarious, and taps into the purity of gaming five seconds at a time. Yet while there are plenty of laughs and Nintendo nuggets to be enjoyed, incorporating in-game characters turn its microgames into awkward platforming jobs dulls the game’s edges, while the lack of any unique Switch gimmicks makes this feels the safest and least inventive entry in the series.                            
60	                                WarioWare: Get It Together's character-swapping gimmick adds unnecessary confusion to a perfectly enjoyable microgame collection.                            
60	                                Microgame madness marred by overcomplications, WarioWare: Get It Together dissolves the fun with frustration.                            
60	                                The least interesting WarioWare entry so far, with overcomplicated multiplayer characters and microgames that seem to have lost their sense of manic invention.                            
60	                                The Switch games attraction is the same as it’s always been for the WarioWare series – personality, replayability and humour – with the added bonus of a strong multiplayer suite. Its latest gimmick isn’t as strong as in previous entries, but it’s not enough to spoil the throwaway fun.                            
55	                                Get It Together! feels like a WarioWare D.I.Y. project that never got finished. As far as I can tell, there’s no mode or method for just playing a random assortment of all 220 or so microgames, in single or multiplayer. The Story mode arranges them in groups of approximately 23 around a set theme, such as “Nintendo Classics” and “That’s Life,” and in solo play that’s about it, especially given how the single-player options in Variety Pack are pretty joyless and feature no microgames at all. For those who are able to find another player or three, Get It Together! offers some decent value, but so much of the side content just isn’t compelling enough to justify a purchase, and it’s hard not to see the Switch’s WarioWare game as another Game & Wario, where the schtick is all there is. At the end of the day, Get It Together! hasn’t even heeded its own admonition. Ironically, the absence of any meaningful online experience means that most will be left to “get it together” on their own.                            
80	                                Ladies and gentlemen, you're looking at one of the sleeper hits of 2021. The game is short and the story can be confusing (also, don't get me started on the voice acting), but gameplay-wise this is a very fun and rewarding action game. Also, it looks incredible on the Nintendo Switch so that's a plus.                            
80	                                I had a blast with Ultra Age and will continue to play this long after this review is written and posted. Even though its narrative is a little thin in its 15+ hour runtime, it truly is the stylish and adrenaline pumping combat that keeps you coming back for more and elevates Ultra Age to the tier of great Switch titles.                            
70	                                With its memorable boss fights, a balanced combat system and a veryinteresting weapon management mechanic, Ultra Age's gameplay comes outon top when faced against its dated visual environment and lack of aninteresting plot. Hack and slash fans will find this a very interestingand enjoyable game.                            
70	                                Ultra Age may not be a complete package, offering little outside it’s compelling combat. However, the moment to moment gameplay is incredibly enjoyable, even if the Nintendo Switch version of the game is noticeably stripped back.                            
70	                                Personally, the engaging combat was more than enough to keep me interested through the game’s fifteen or so hours. The rest of the game around those battles is decent enough glue. Awkward and rough, but charmingly awkward and rough.                            
70	                                Ultra Age is a solid indie hack-and-slash effort that delivers some fast-paced combat and a handful of unique mechanics to keep its battles interesting. It may have some ropey voice-acting, the graphics have predictably been dialled back on Switch and there's the occasional frame rate wobble here and there, but overall this is a surprisingly decent budget effort that's well worth taking a look at if you're hankering for some Devil May Cry-style action.                            
60	                                Ultra Age is the sort of game that could have benefited from more polish and a stronger narrative. The performance on Nintendo Switch is disappointing, but the largest problems with the title are with the narrative structure and presentation. If there is ever a future for this franchise, the focus needs to be on building the existing combat into a cohesive storyline, because right now, it just doesn't cut it.                            
60	                                How willing are you to forgive a title's flaws to enjoy its fights? This is the question to ask yourself if you are interested in Ultra Age. On the one hand, the title suffers from dated visuals and a jagged rhythm. On the other hand, his clashes benefit from animations and dynamic effects. By this ambivalence, the title remains to be reserved for fans of beat 'em up able to disregard many aspects to appreciate a rather nice gameplay.                             
90	                                Ruined King: A League of Legends story is one of the best turn-based RPGs released this year. Featuring extremely smooth mechanics and exquisite visuals, Ruined King can keep players glued to their gaming chairs for hours at a time. How much League of Legends lore Ruined King reveals is easily the cherry on top, too. There's a thrilling story within for everyone who chooses to give the game a try, one that comes highly recommended.                            
90	                                While it doesn't innovate the formula introduced in Battle Chasers: Nightwar too much, Ruined King: A League of Legends Story's quality is undeniably high, so much that even those with little to no knowledge of the League of Legends universe can enjoy the game fully. With an engaging story, charming characters and amazing combat system, the game by Airship Syndicate is the best possible debut for Riot Forge, and one of the best role-playing games released this year.                            
88	                                I don’t know whether to recommend Ruined King: A League of Legends Story for the interesting story set in the League of Legends universe or because it's one of the best turn-based RPGs I played since quite a while. I’d stick towards the second reason, leaving the first one as the icing on the cake. An engaging storyline, beautifully characterized and customizable characters, and a combat system that will test your tactical skills await you, especially if you dare to play at higher difficulty levels. Will Runeterra’s champions become the new Avengers?                            
85	                                Ruined King is an RPG with undoubted qualities. Thanks to the fundamental artistic contribution of Joe "Mad" Madureira, the work manages to capture the attention of both fans who live permanently in Runeterra and newbies who have never heard of League of Legends.                             
85	                                Despite some resemblance to Battle Chasers: Nightwar, with Ruined King: A League of Legend Story the developers make a step forward and deliver us a more refined experience, suitable for veterans and newcomers to League of Legends.                            
83	                                By masterfully evolving a winning formula, adding the Riot touch to that of Madureira, Airship Syndicate proves once more that passion always makes the difference and that, sometimes, it helps to overcome some flaws.                            
83	                                Quotation forthcoming.                            
80	                                Even though it's not far from a skin for Battle Chasers, Ruined King certainly is a good RPG, with a great story and brilliant ost. Definitively a nice way to learn more about Runeterra and the extended universe of Riot's success, League of Legends.                            
80	                                Ruined King: A League of Legends Story isn't reinventing the wheel, that's for sure. However, its solid game systems make it quite a recommendable RPG, especially for LoL fans. They will be able to appreciate the reinterpretation of their favorite universe by Airship Syndicate and Joe Madureira. And while we regret a somewhat conventional writing that sometimes lacks subtlety, we appreciate being able to immerse ourselves in the alleys of Bilgewater and the Dark Isles in the company of charismatic champions.                             
80	                                After 3 hours, Ruined King: A League of Legends Story becomes enjoyable to play, with combat and exploration phases that flow really well. The balance between "puzzles" and fighting is quite good, and if you add to that a lot of side quests, crafting and lore, you get a game that should please dungeon crawler, turn-based RPG or League of Legends aficionados. On the other hand, the complexity of the combat interface can be a bit daunting, especially at the beginning. Connoisseurs and those who played Battle Chasers Nightwar will not be disoriented and should have a good time.                            
80	                                Ruined King: A League Of Legends Story is a passionate love letter to the League Of Legends universe, but that shouldn’t put off anyone looking to explore Runeterra for the first time. Full of compelling characters and a stunning environment, Ruined King is well worth the dive for any RPG fan.                            
90	                                Happy Game isn’t for the squeamish or those with any particular phobias, but anyone looking for a short horror experience a la Little Nightmares or something that isn’t just another first-person jump scare fest would do well to chase this one down.                            
90	                                Two very acidic, bloody and emotionally powerful hours, full of symbolism and meanings, which should possibly be experienced in a single, distressing session. Good night and sweet dreams.                             
88	                                Happy Game is a new gem crafted by Amanita Design. It deserves to be played, even if you don't like adventure games.                            
85	                                Happy Games takes us, ironically, to a dark, nightmare world where puzzles require gruesome solutions.                             
82	                                Happy Game is the most enjoyable nightmare of this year. Amanita Design´s new gem is another great point and click adventure game in the personal Amanita´s style, with a superb horrific and macabre tone in this occasion.                            
80	                                Quotation forthcoming.                            
70	                                Happy Game sends players on a shrieking, blood-soaked odyssey through the candy-colored hell within a young boy’s subconscious. Though it’s weakened somewhat by a less-cohesive third act, overall it’s a vivid interactive nightmare with a striking aesthetic and powerful narrative conceit.                            
70	                                Those looking for a short, unsettling stroll can find one with Happy Game. One thing to note about it is that it's a short romp, able to be completed in just a few hours. There's nothing that would make me want to revisit it, but I certainly can't fault it for what it is: a seasonal treat filled with tricks.                            
65	                                I’m not sure whether to recommend Happy Game or not. I think most people will be disappointed with its short play time and easier puzzles. Any fan of Amanita will definitely find joy in this new direction for the studio but will maybe be let down in comparison to past titles’ puzzles. In short, Happy Game is good, people should play it, but wait for a sale.                            
63	                                Despite the alluring and violent art, Happy Game is dragged down by simple and random puzzles, annoying screen flashes, and awkward interactions.                            
90	                                A high-quality adaptation of the board game with plenty of content and rich replayability. What it does seek to offer, the gaming experience of a classic tabletop board game for one or more players, it achieves in an almost flawless way.                            
87	                                It's still one of the best dungeon crawlers ever made, but now it's on PC.                            
85	                                Gloomhaven’s jump from board game to PC keeps the game as strategic and satisfying as it ever was, all while streamlining the experience and opening it up to new avenues of play. The genuine effort of the creators shows through to a game that is worthy for fans and newcomers alike to struggle against the hordes of doom that threaten your very cards.                            
85	                                An excellent digital version of a very good boardgame. Good for both veterans of the tabletop version (due to new content like the Guildmaster campaign) and newbies willing to try a peculiar fantasy experience (and manage a lot of cards).                            
80	                                Gloomhaven is a great way to bring the boardgame powerhouse to the PC and let many players enjoy its strategic and puzzle structure.                            
80	                                Gloomhaven is a solid version of the classic tabletop experience that offers turn-based combat, unique classes and abilities, and detailed quests.                             
80	                                At its core, Gloomhaven is a deep tactical experience that’s immensely satisfying once you get to grips with its layers upon layers of systems. It also includes multiple options to vary the difficulty, so newer players don’t feel overly punished by making mistakes, whilst strategy aficionados can dial up the challenge to match their ability.                            
75	                                Although I was far from mastering the techniques and rules of Gloomhaven after my time with it for review, I do commend Flaming Fowl for a job well done. They have delivered a well-curated digital version of an extremely complex and intimidating tabletop experience — fans of the original or those curious to dip a toe in without breaking the bank should check it out.                            
70	                                That aside, Asmodee continues to demonstrate why it is the best digital board game developer going around. Gloomhaven itself is a little insular compared to the likes of Game of Thrones, Arkham Horror, Ticket to Ride, Pathfinder and Lord of the Rings, so I suspect it will appeal to a narrower band of players than some of Asmodee's other adaptations, but the faithful quality of that adaptation and the stellar production values make it an easy sell to existing Gloomhaven fans, and the ideal way to those that were intimidated by the size (and cost) of the box when they've seen it in their local game store to give it a go in the first place.                            
70	                                Gloomhaven offers hours of mental challenges with a sophisticated battle system. It is based on a board game but tries to go beyond that. Those already attracted to the idea of Gloomhaven can have it here for less assembly and with an additional Guildmaster mode. Since this digital version becomes tiresome after a while because the vast number of missions ultimately feel repetitive, it’s better to play in small doses. The game is recommendable, but probably playing it online with friends in co-op mode is closer to the original’s experience.                            
50	                                Gloomhaven tries to bring the experience of the board game on our screens, but fails to recreate the feel of being around a table. The game, although very loyal to the source, lacks pacing and the missions (very repetitive after a while), even at the lowest levels, are incredibly hard and for the most part frustrating. It is definitely overwhelming for a new player, and way too much relying on RNG for a good result. A good opportunity that sadly doesn’t really deliver.                             
100	                                Above all else, In Sound Mind is fun. The horror and melancholy of what’s going on in the plot is balanced out by light-hearted camp, the levels are all interwoven exploration puzzles where a new tool invariably makes you realize several new areas you can discover, it’s all so easy to just get lost for hours and hours until next thing you know it’s 3AM.                            
90	                                A psychological horror game with a focus on narrative consistency and gameplay variety, In Sound Mind is a great time due to excellent pacing, level design, and pure ingenuity, even if it's not particularly scary.                            
80	                                In Sound Mind is a solid psychological horror with a lot of surprises and it’s an overall great experience.                            
80	                                In Sound Mind takes a very particular approach to horror to become a strange adventure with solid exploration and interesting narrative.                            
80	                                I enjoyed In Sound Mind far more than I expected to, thanks to the great variety to its puzzles and overall atmosphere. While the final revelations didn't blow me away, they did bring a wry smile to my face. In Sound Mind is one of my favourite indie horror games of the past few years and is highly recommended if you’re a fan of the genre.                            
80	                                The true success of In Sound Mind comes from the atmosphere that We Create Stuff has crafted. The puzzles are smart and well-thought-out, the jump scares that the game utilizes don't feel forced or cheesy, and the drastically different style of each tape shines through to create a spooky, complete-feeling game.                            
75	                                In Sound Mind definitely has some limitations in terms of its presentation and combat, but these elements don’t take too much away from what it does well. It’s more of a spooky mystery than a full horror title, and with its hub world, clever secrets, and evolving set of tools, it continually presents new opportunities to interact with its twisted environments. If you like games that try to screw with your head, it’s worth booking a session with Dr. Wales.                            
75	                                It’s a bit disappointing to see that In Sound Mind doesn’t quite transcend outdated horror tropes, even though it has the potential to. But that doesn’t take away from the accomplishments that make it more intriguing than many contemporary titles: its thought-provoking puzzles, and its attempts to tell an engaging story without unnecessarily scaring you to death first.                            
75	                                In Sound Mind is a well-done psychological horror, fun and stimulating from start to finish. It’s less scary than expected and could be improved from a technical standpoint, but the mix of gameplay elements knows how to stimulate the player by offering them a new element to use in each level.                            
75	                                In Sound Mind excels at its atmosphere and characterization of Desmond and the delusions of his patients. Combat can feel a little lackluster, and the story structure is formulaic. However, there is a love of horror on display found in the environments and core design of the experience.                            
75	                                In Sound Mind is a surprisingly compelling title, offering an interesting story and strong horror experience. However, some aspects start to outlive their welcome - if only due to annoyance. Tackling a sensitive subject like mental health, In Sound Mind could have really fallen flat if We Create Stuff didn't handle it well, and while it can come across as heavy-handed at times, this is generally well done and worth experiencing.                            
70	                                In short, it is far from equaling the pillars from which it is inspired (Outlast, Layers of Fear, Silent Hill ...) or even from being a very good game, despite a certain potential.                             
70	                                In Sound Mind is a psychological thriller that tells a twisted story about corrupted and ill minds, but fails to be coherent and often presents bad design choices.                            
68	                                All told, In Sound Mind wasn’t the game I was expecting. But I still found myself pushing forward, eager to uncover a little bit more. If you’ve got any appetite for cerebral horror and puzzle solving, In Sound Mind might be just what you’re looking for.                            
66	                                In Sound Mind tells an interesting story and provides an intriguing combination of first-person exploration, puzzles and shooting, but it fails to have the impact it could’ve had due to bland visuals, mediocre combat, and the fact that it’s a horror game that isn’t very scary.                            
60	                                In a way, it’s a shame that In Sound Mind has the fundamentals of survival horror down so well I can’t help but imagine how much more compelling it would be if it weren’t let down by its heavy-handed writing and dull enemies.                            
60	                                In Sound Mind is a solid horror game brought down by massive problems. It never runs smoothly and the controls are imprecise. The worst part during our time with the game was when we had to circumvent a game-breaking bug by triggering another bug on purpose.                            
90	                                TOEM isn't a long game, and it's not a difficult one, but it's perfect if you want to enjoy a cute, low-key gaming experience that's built around a photo mode. [Issue #56 – November/December 2021, p. 25]                            
90	                                Toem is the absolute pinnacle of easy-going gaming, and although it's a bit brief you'll never want to leave its gorgeous black and white world.                            
90	                                TOEM is suitable for all audiences. Everything from its friendly nature, to the ease of control, to the cute characters and catchy tunes, TOEM hits the mark in many ways. Though I wish it were longer, a part of me thinks the short length adds to the simplicity and relaxation aspect of the experience. It was just so inviting, especially during days where you want to do something easy and not necessarily feel too challenged, making me wish there was more content and areas to explore. TOEM 2, perhaps?                            
90	                                TOEM is a short, densely packed, and extremely satisfying little adventure that smartly fills every corner of its world with something beautiful to see or another cute animal to discover.                            
90	                                Overall, TOEM is a remarkable take on the photography game genre, if it is a genre at all. You take pictures both to progress in the game and for your own pleasure, with each shot further strengthening your link to the in-game world and its delightful characters. While it's predominantly a happy-go-lucky experience, there are some poignant moments, and it's a game that could stay in your heart long after you beat it.                             
83	                                TOEM is an all-around charming photo adventure with heartwarming stories and quirky characters, but pretty short and shallow characters, but pretty short and shallow.                            
83	                                There’s no big bad to cross, no huge conflict to overcome – just a small adventure with joy and happiness aplenty. TOEM elicited more than a few genuine chuckles from me as I played, barely able to put it down from start to finish. For anyone looking to vibe out and play something with a genuine sincerity to its giant heart, TOEM is an easy recommendation.                            
80	                                Like a great album you put on at the end of the day to wind down, Toem is an incredibly relaxing experience that you'll wish you could experience all over again once it's finished. It almost makes us want to start capturing photographs of the world around us, but sadly, we don’t have a duck dressed as a lighthouse keeper to show them to. If only.                            
80	                                Toem might be short, but with the number of challenges, and you can finish it an afternoon if you’re looking for something fun and relaxing to throw yourself at, or dip in and out to complete every little side mission. With the winter evenings drawing in, Toem is the kind of game I can see myself coming back to with a hot chocolate and a blanket, as I settle in to bring a little joy to the denizens of the world of Toem.                             
80	                                End of game issues aside TOEM is a delightful, relaxed, monochrome game on Nintendo Switch. The music is peaceful, and favourite tracks can be listened to at any point, making it an ideal break from a busy life. The interesting characters provide a lot of laughs with their bizarre requests, cataloguing all the creatures brings its own amusement like watching a snail win a race against itself, and there is so much humour that the absence of colour is not noticed or missed.                            
80	                                TOEM is an exquisite expedition into a minimalist black and white world without being simplistic. With a ton of objects to collect and puzzles to solve with your camera, the small independent game offers a variety of charming activities, all in a relaxing atmosphere. Far too short, we would have liked to spend more time on it.                            
80	                                Toem has you take your time, frame things up, put the zoom on proper, and take as many tries as you’d like to get it right with good music to accompany the process. It’s a short-lived expedition and can get choppy on the switch when there’s a lot going on in an area, but it’s still a charming experience I very much enjoyed my time with. I wouldn’t mind seeing more games take this more carefree route to a photographic experience in video games.                            
80	                                TOEM is a light and funny story, which makes you put your hand to the camera much more often than necessary. Nothing can be done about it: the temptation to capture in an image the beauty, the light-heartedness and the joy of the creatures that inhabit this world is too much to ignore.                            
80	                                TOEM is one of the many wholesome games available on Switch, but it is one that stands out thanks to its unique hand-drawn art style and enjoyable perspective mechanics. A short but sweet, frame-by-frame adventure.                            
80	                                TOEM is a short but satisfying little photography adventure packed with witty writing and picturesque moments to capture.                            
80	                                Toem is an utterly delightful Switch photography game that is filled with personality and doesn’t wear out its welcome. It rewards you for taking your time and paying attention. Which doesn’t mean you can’t rush through and finish it in a single weekend if you’d like. But it is the sort of adventure that goes out of its way to make someone feel comfortable. And with all of its little details, I imagine a player might be able to return a few times to check out little extras they might have missed.                            
75	                                Toem is a very pleasant and relaxing game. Ideal for playing with the family, this little photography game is smarter than it looks, thanks to a simple, but effective concept, well-made little puzzles and a universe without artifice, but cute as everything. Very short and accessible, the title of Something We Made is undoubtedly what you need if you want to indulge in a peaceful experience, populated by characters as absurd as they are amusing. It doesn't go any further than that, doesn't pretend to, and that is undoubtedly very good.                             
75	                                TOEM is a game that knows how to overcome its flaws, delivering an adventure full of charm to make the player happy.                            
72	                                TOEM is a calm expedition where photography will be an ally in discovery, not the main point. The way in which the art was used both for exploration and for photography is surprising, however the game lacks repetition in certain moments.                            
70	                                When you reach Toem, the event itself, it really does feel spectacular in the context of the game. More important, though, is what it represents. Toem is a simple, cute fable about growing up and engaging with the world. And like the phenomenon, it's really best if you see it for yourself.                            
70	                                Don't get me wrong, my time with TOEM while playing was a lot of fun. The little contradictions I came across during my time with the game didn't really sink in until after I finished the game. I did put in the time and collected as many stamps as possible. But even so, you should expect to stick too long to TOEM. Once you've seen everything, there really isn't that much to return to. Still, in some cases I'd argue that the journey is the destination. When it comes to TOEM the journey can be a little tedious and sometimes even a bit repetitive. But if you're looking for a slow paced game to relax over a weekend there's still a lot of charm and enjoyment to be found here.                            
70	                                TOEM perfectly represents the beauty of the journey rather than reaching the destination. A relaxing and enjoyable experience armed with a camera.                            
100	                                Eastward is a beautiful adventure, full of complexity and memorable characters that makes a world full of pixels seem larger than life.                            
90	                                Eastward is a masterful title sure to put Pixpil on the map. The pixel art and animations are top notch, the characters are brilliantly well-written and the story intriguing. The gameplay is perfect blend of RPG and action-adventure and there’s so much game to play. Not to mention the entirety of Earth Born. Eastward should be high on any indie fan’s watchlist!                            
90	                                Simultaneously a throwback and a breath of something new, Eastward is a magic trick of blending familiarity with novelty and grim apocalyptic sci-fi with wide-eyed fantasy.                            
90	                                Eastward is a beautiful love letter to old school RPGs and arcade games, bursting with unique characters, amazing attention to detail, stunning retro-pixel artwork, and a moving story that is bound to stay with you.                            
90	                                Eastward is an exceptional adventure game that does just about anything it does, and manages to hold its boat with a masterful hand in the 20 hours it takes to finish it.                            
90	                                A post-apocalyptic action-adventure framed as a train journey through a cute heartfelt story of discovery, loyalty, and the bonds we form with others, Eastward shines like a diamond on the Switch. It’s wholesome, it’s original, it’s quirky, and it’s full of that special ingredient that turns a little indie into a must-play. Eastward’s graphics, narrative, and characters draw you in almost effortlessly and keep a tight hold until this train has come to a complete stop.                             
85	                                Eastward will be on many shortlists for indie GOTY, and possibly on some main lists as well. If you like what you see, don't hesitate to pick this one up.                            
84	                                Eastward is a game about a journey and the characters you meet along the way. Although the combat and puzzles are quite typical, the setting, sound and art style are remarkable, making this an essential trek through an incredible world.                            
83	                                There is primarily great content in Eastward for its low price, and it serves to scratch a lot of itches with its varied inspirations. It’s not without stumbles, but it is an easy recommendation for fans of not just Earthbound, Zelda, or Mario & Luigi, but RPGs in general. Pick it up, have a blast, maybe shed some tears, and spread the word: Eastward is something special.                             
82	                                An atmospheric adventure with an astonishing world and exceptional characters who carry the game even over some lengthy sections.                            
80	                                I finished Eastward burdened with regret and melancholy, but I can't deny the joy it inspired, nor the many, many colorful friends who made this darkly hopeful tale all the more memorable. Maybe this is a sign that I ought to appreciate what I found rather than lament what I missed. Not a bad takeaway, wouldn't you say? [Issue #56 – November/December 2021, p. 26]                            
80	                                The action is quite familiar to anyone who has played a few games of this genre before, and the game suffers from a few pacing issues that are made worse by how straightforward it tends to be mechanically. Still, that does little to diminish how excellent the game is overall. The strength of its main characters and the desire to see just what is coming next makes Eastward a very tough game to put down.                            
80	                                For as gorgeous as Eastward‘s graphics are, and as endearing as some of its characters become, and as much as I need its soundtrack on vinyl as soon as possible, it also falls short in some ways that leave its conclusion feeling a bit off. It’s one of the more promising debuts I’ve seen, and Pixpil has ensured I’ll be incredibly interested in whatever they do next. Eastward is something a fan of pixel art and good music, with a weakness for video game nostalgia, deserves to check out. It’s just also a journey that left me wanting a little more.                            
80	                                Slightly lumpy pacing aside, though, Eastward feels like a bright, beautifully rendered action-RPG, with a uniquely positive atmosphere. Those looking for a lighthearted experience would do well to take the trip.                            
80	                                Eastward may not be perfect, but it doesn’t need to be. The creativity on display is fantastic, and the gameplay is fun and varied. It’s an adventure you won’t be quick to forget.                            
80	                                Eastward is an adventure game that features a stunning visualpresentation and art style, which alone makes it worth to explore thegame world and its levels. The game also features great synergy-buildingbetween characters when it comes to combat and puzzles that makes theadventure all the more interesting, and while there is a lot ofbacktracking and some performance issues on television screens atmoments with many characters at the same time, Eastward is still along-lasting, stunning looking and captivating experience.                            
80	                                Eastward proves itself to be a memorable and enjoyable mashup of many beloved classic titles, combining each of their elements together to forge something that feels distinct and engaging. Creative gameplay sequences, a heartwarming and emotional story, and a killer art style all combine to make this one easy to recommend. That being said, we’d also offer a word of caution that this is a slow burn kind of game; if you’re not a patient player, Eastward’s sometimes lethargic pace may take a lot of enjoyment out of the experience. Wherever you may fall, Eastward is indisputably a game worth checking out, and we’d encourage you to give it a shot.                            
80	                                Eastward delivers so well on the writing and soundtrack front that it’s easy to forgive its otherwise simplistic gameplay. The fully realized world has its charm, but it hardly breaks the mold anywhere else. While it doesn't do anything necessarily offensive, it does demand more when the rest of the game is so well done. It’s clear Pixpil have got the writing chops down, now let’s tighten up some of the stuff around it.                            
75	                                The result is a beautiful game with a lot of heart but no clear, coherent storyline and a few disappointing characters.                            
70	                                What starts as a great journey, reminiscence of some great 16bit games of the 90s, ends up severely slowing down its rhythm and pace thus losing its chance to shine.                            
70	                                Eastward contains phenomenal art and colorful writing, yet the plot meanders breezily from moment to moment with little care for pacing and an unoriginal core storyline. Factor in average combat and puzzle-solving and a couple bugs that should be addressed, and Eastward is not quite as fun to play as it could be. That being said, a lot of people are going to fall completely in love with it anyway for the things it does right, and you might be one of them.                            
60	                                The game’s aesthetic is wondrous, but you may remember Eastward most for its disrespect for the player’s time.                            
60	                                Eastward is a great game. It’s beautiful, it’s a story well-told, and it’s very fun to play. But for me, the entire experience was tainted by what I quickly and inescapably perceived as racist and sexually exploitative depictions, which is just such a monumental shame of a thing to tarnish an otherwise incredible experience. I mean, this game has an entire virtual RPG video game built into it that you can play. But I simply can’t rate this experience highly with how tarnished my view of it all is. I love playing it, I recommend playing it, but I also insist you judge for yourself these character depictions and whether they meet the standards we should expect from games.                            
60	                                The 2D visuals are absolutely stunning, but the simplistic action and pretentious storytelling undermine what could have been a true neo-retro classic.                            
50	                                Eastward gets away with a lot because of its blindingly beautiful pixel-graphics. Yet with each hour this especially slow game drags on, it has become increasingly clear that this beauty is solely external. Regardless of the bunches of dialogues and a memorable cast, the game simply can't get its feet off the ground.                            
90	                                Prinny Presents NIS Classics Volume 1: Phantom Brave: The Hermuda Triangle Remastered / Soul Nomad & the World Eaters may only be the first in the Prinny Presents series, but it’s already off to a phenomenal start. Whether you played these titles when they first came out or are heading into them for the very first time, this two-in-one bundle is something that you won’t want to skip out on if you’re even remotely interested in SRPGs.                            
90	                                The inconsistency of these two underground classics might make the compilation facade seem like a wasted opportunity, but being realistic here, both of the two titles in the Prinny Presents NIS Classics Vol. 1 would not have got a release without being bundled together in this gimmick. Whether you have fond memories of having played either, or simply never had the chance to previously,  you'll find quickly that both games represent a creative energy that we rarely see these days, and in both cases the experimentation largely works. You're not likely to see anything like these two again, so don't miss the opportunity.                            
83	                                NIS Classics Volume 1 is bursting with SRPG goodness from a few generations ago. Although these games look dated, they're both still great fun to play with their own unique approaches to gameplay, story, and humour. Thanks for bringing them back, Prinny!                            
80	                                The art and sound for these two feels pixel accurate to what you’d remember from the PS2 era, so the nostalgia is in full effect. These remasters also come with all of the DLC bonus content that was added in subsequent re-releases and versions, which is nice for those wanting to dig deeper into the content but no special frills for the NIS collection itself. This is a great little package that is sure to make some classic RPG fans feel sentimental and it holds up to modern sensibilities. I will note that some of the verbiage and story beats can get a little on the graphic side (i.e., not playing to contemporary tastes), but otherwise I would recommend this collection. As it turns out, NIS’ catalog, while grindy, still holds up compared to what you’d play today.                            
80	                                It isn’t all about graphics when you get to play two charming slices of off-the-wall Japanese lunacy like in NIS Classics.                            
80	                                An excellent collection for tactical RPG fans. The genre can often be pigeon-holed into being full of FFT clones, but both included games here manage to nicely stand out both from that series and NIS America’s own Disgaea. With a variety of tones offered up in each game, they each help scratch the itch for SRPG fans while also working for those wanting a more serious experience in Soul Nomad or who want to kick back with a light-hearted tale with Phantom Brave. Both games are fun to play, but it’s a shame more wasn’t done to help the visuals out as both do suffer from blurry character sprites that clash against the backgrounds that actually did get more work done for modern-day displays.                            
70	                                All in all, Prinny Presents NIS Classics Volume 1 is two classic games in one visibly aged package. If you’re interested in seeing what else the people behind Disgaea have been working on, this will be a real treat. However, I wouldn’t recommend these games to people who aren’t already fans of NIS titles. And if you’re a Soul Nomad fan, then what are you waiting for? Not only did NIS finally port the game to a new console, but it also threw in a free second game.                            
60	                                A lazy collection of two problematic titles videogames of the strategic genre and role-playing games. Unfortunately, not enough has been done, despite the fun gameplay.                            
60	                                Prinny Presents NIS Classics Vol. 1 is a brilliant idea in concept. Nippon Ichi has a large library of games that deserve to be readily available to modern players. However, they need to take the advancements found in recent remasters and apply those options to these titles. Phantom Brave is a lengthy and beautiful JRPG with its remastered assets, but Soul Nomad & the World Eaters really doesn’t compare, and it shows from the second you boot of the game.                            
55	                                Prinny Presents NIS Classics Volume 1 for Nintendo Switch is a disappointing release of two very good tactical RPGs thanks to stability issues, bugs, and a lack of polish for games that deserve a lot better.                            
50	                                We’re always fans of seeing lesser-known games in any genre get a bit of love and exposure to new players, and the two games in the NIS Classics Volume 1 collection both have a lot to offer tactics fans. Phantom Brave’s combat system is unique among tactical RPGs and Soul Nomad’s take on the hero’s journey is still interesting 15 years after its PS2 release. However, both games feel even older than they are; the unattractive visuals and uneven voice acting of this compilation re-release aren’t going to change anyone’s mind who wasn’t a fan before, nor prove attractive for a new audience.                            
95	                                Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic is still exceptional 18 years later, and this new Switch port is the best version we’ve ever played.                             
95	                                Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic (Switch) is a faithful port of an already outstanding RPG. Barring small graphical artifacts, an oversized text box, and multiple loading screens, KOTOR is an easy recommendation for Switch owners that RPGs should strive to emulate: Your character’s stats matter, your character’s actions have consequences, and the worlds you visit are lively. Even more: If this port doesn’t make you excited for the upcoming KOTOR remaster, I don’t know what will. If you’re not the biggest Star Wars fan, I can assure you that you just might be after playing this game. If you’re currently a Star Wars fan and have yet to play this game…what are you doing? Drop what you’re doing and pick up KOTOR.                            
90	                                Overall, KOTOR on Nintendo Switch is well worth picking up. Not only is it relatively cheap at $15, it's still one of the very best RPGs you can play. And it's high on the list of the best Star Wars games available. There's a reason people want more KOTOR.                            
90	                                Knights of the Old Republic is still one of the best games ever made, even if it's not received any particular improvements on its older versions. The main pull here is that players can finally enjoy the title on the go via the Switch, and for Star Wars fans who have never played the game before it's another opportunity to enjoy one of the best Star Wars stories ever told. There will no doubt be debates about PC versus Switch for Knights of the Old Republic, and those who already own the game already aren't missing anything if they ignore this new port, but none of that takes away from one of the true classics of the early 2000s.                            
90	                                If you’ve somehow managed to come this far without playing Star Wars: Knight of the Old Republic, you’ll definitely want to dig into this. It’s a great port of an all-time classic RPG, one that handily stands the test of time. For Star Wars fans, it may well serve as the same oasis now that it did back in 2003. Even those who have played the game before may find a return trip worth embarking upon, particularly with how nicely it plays on the Switch.                            
90	                                A phenomenal RPG, one that has withstood tests of time. Nearly 20 years on, and it remains an enjoyable experience. Be you a new fan, or old, KOTOR is a must-play for Star Wars and RPG fans. Light or dark? Only you can decide.                            
90	                                Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic is frankly a fantastic game and is objectively one of the best Star Wars games ever made. The languages are accurate, the character designs are flawless, and the art design is incredible. It's no surprise that the game is revered by both standard RPG and Star Wars fans, and thankfully, the Switch version pulls through with a highly efficient port.                            
90	                                Coming in at $14.99, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic on Switch is an easy recommendation. While certainly showing its age in the gameplay and visual department, the fantastic story, characters, and lore found within have stood the test of time and remain some of the best that the old Expanded Universe had to offer. Even in this age of NFTs, Dogecoin, season passes, and games-as-a-service, Knights of the Old Republic remains a WRPG classic that Switch owners should run out and experience. May the force be with you.                            
90	                                Even though it is nearly twenty years old and I can’t wait to see how my next playthrough goes since Knights of the Old Republic is a game that keeps on giving.                             
90	                                Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic remains one of the best games ever made and arguably the best Star Wars game. Aside from shorter loading times and higher resolution, nothing is drastically changed on Switch, which is perfectly fine as this is one of those games that doesn’t need much tinkering.                            
88	                                It’s easy to look back with rose tinted glasses when it comes to Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic. But after spending a week back in this world I can easily say there are no tinted glasses here. It’s as good as I recalled it back in the day. If you’ve never played Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic this is a great way to jump in. I couldn’t believe a game that came out in 2003 could still hold my attention, even on the fifth or sixth playthrough that I had while reviewing the game. The atmosphere created by the game is second to none when it comes to Star Wars games. Playing on the Nintendo Switch might be the best way to experience, load screens were fast, and the game looks great in handheld mode. The Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic story is one every Star Wars fan should experience.                            
80	                                Overall, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic is a classic RPG with one of the best Star Wars stories in the franchise. It is priced at $14.99, and I say it is worth it! There is plenty of replay value, trying for different endings and seeing different responses in your dialogue choices. Will you go Dark, Light, or Neutral? Will you bully your way through quests or try to be diplomatic? Play it, you ‘meatbag’!                            
80	                                For years, despite being an avid Star Wars fan who eagerly devours movies, shows, books, and games, Knights of the Old Republic had eluded me. Despite multiple attempts it had just never clicked. Finally now, playing it on Switch I think I understand. While elements of its design certainly haven’t aged as gracefully as others, it still tells a complex and dynamically evolving narrative. It provides a depth that few Star Wars games have and its place in the timeline makes it relevant to modern fans even if you otherwise have no interest in legends content. Yes you’ll spend a long time running back and forth across the dunes of Tatooine but the payoff is always worth it. Save for the potential of the recently announced remake, this is easily the best experience I’ve had playing this game and I can now earnestly hope the sequel finds its way to Switch as well.                            
76	                                It’s still a good story, though, with an arc and characters that impressed 2003 Star Wars fans and RPG players hungry for more of what they loved best. Mechanically, the moment-to-moment gameplay definitely shows its age and the writing isn’t as strong or nuanced as we might remember it being. There’s a bit of consolation prize sadness around this unadorned, unimproved semi-museum piece coming to Switch, which won’t be seeing Aspyr’s remake when it’s released. Knights of the Old Republic looks and plays like the exceptionally good game it most certainly was in 2003, but it’s hard not to see, hear and feel all the ways in which games have moved on since.                            
70	                                One of the most popular games in the Star Wars series lands on theNintendo Switch and if this conversion of Knights of the Old Republicdoesn't bring anything new from a technical and gameplay point of view,the work was masterfully done and it delivers the original game toeveryone who wanted to play it on the Nintendo Switch. Those who areless versed in the Star Wars universe and unfamiliar with the originalwork won't feel the same appeal, as this effort is mostly targeted atlong-running fans.                            
70	                                Time has not been kind to some elements, but KOTOR’s story and characters are still the most interesting there’s ever been in a Star Wars video game.                            
70	                                Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic may have lost some of its luster as the years have gone on, but the foundations of a well-written and enjoyable RPG haven’t aged a day. If you can get past things like awkward controls, middling presentation, and a complete lack of handholding, the 30-ish hour campaign offers up an engaging romp through the beloved Star Wars universe. We’d give KOTOR on Switch a strong recommendation to any fans of Star Wars or RPGs in general, just with the caveat that you’ll get more out of it if you can stomach archaic game design elements.                            
70	                                Bioware’s first RPG foray into gaming stole the hearts of myself, and I’m sure others has not aged well, and has a lot of difficulties to overcome.                            
90	                                Alan Wake was already considered an exceptional game and over a decade later, this adventure holds up strong. Finding myself completely captivated, Remedy left me wanting more, even after completing the DLC. It’s regrettable that Remastered’s cutscenes have problems and I hope they can be patched, but ultimately, it’s a fine job. If you’re a fan of mystery thrillers, I cannot recommend Alan Wake Remastered highly enough.                            
90	                                Fans of Control or those simply curious about who ‘that Alan Wake guy’ is would do well to pick this remastered edition up. At a solid asking price, it’s a fantastic narrative experience that’s worth playing even with the janky older controls, while returning fans will get a kick out of reliving the experience on modern hardware.                            
90	                                If it’s your first time visiting Bright Falls or you just want to take in the scenery again before the next chapter in Remedy’s overarching franchise rears its head, there’s no better way to experience Alan Wake’s original nightmare.                            
90	                                Alan Wake Remastered is a definite improvement in the visual department, offering the same great story and intense gameplay throughout.                            
90	                                Although some visual and design elements feel a bit dated, Alan Wake Remastered is the definitive version of an all-time classic horror game.                            
88	                                Alan Wake Remastered is a much profound work that you may think. The change in engine and all the improvements, makes it a great return to Bright Falls.                             
88	                                Alan Wake has aged well and still offers a compelling thriller story with some fun gameplay to keep you entertained for a dozen or fifteen hours. Whether you missed the game way back when it first came out, or just haven’t played it in a decade, it’s a worthy addition to any collection.                            
85	                                If you look at Alan Wake Remastered as a brand new game that you never played before, you’ll definitely have some good time with this psychological thriller, but if you already played the original version then don’t expect any significant changes as the 2 versions are basically the same.                            
85	                                Alan Wake Remastered is the definitive way to play Remedy's psychological horror. Its stellar action and mysterious story still hold up to this day, and a fresh coat of paint makes Bright Falls shine. With a fair price, this remaster is an absolute must for newcomers of the franchise.                            
85	                                Up until that bizarre glitch, enjoying Alan Wake Remastered was like the best kind of deja vu. Muscle memory steered me toward the hidden caches, triggered reminders to backtrack just a little here and there or look around that corner for collectibles. Alan’s somewhat stiff voice, the ancient rockers, Barry—all of these things, campy as they were, welcomed me home. Those cold waters of Cauldron Lake sure are impossible to escape.                            
85	                                Alan Wake Remastered is a prime example of if it isn’t broken, don’t fix it. The story, and the way it’s told is truly timeless, and it's a game that everyone should experience. Some of its design might be stuck in the past, but none of it ever feels detrimental to the overall experience, and the visual facelift just makes the experience that much better. Whether you’re a new fan of Remedy’s work, or a long-time player, there’s never been a better excuse to visit or return to Bright Falls.                            
85	                                Despite a few ageing visuals and dodgy mechanics, Alan Wake is just as captivating and memorable as it was 11 years ago. With satisfying combat, a brilliantly-paced story, and fantastic setting, Remedy's horror-thriller is absolutely worth the punt if you're a fan of the studio's more recent output or just have a curious interest in horror.                            
85	                                It's by no means a technical wonder, but its "lifting" is enough to keep up with current standards. Story and atmosphere are kept unaltered for a good reason: they still are tremendously engaging.                            
85	                                Alan Wake is a gold standard when it comes to telling an incredible story, and nothing has changed with that in Alan Wake Remastered. The gameplay still feels pretty awesome, even if it sometimes shows its age, but nothing about that detracts from one of the best games of the last decade which feels at home, for the most part, in 2021. Visually, this game is taken to new heights, and even if it doesn’t look or play as good as Control, Alan Wake Remastered, like the Bioshock Collection before, will leave players remembering that wonderful day in May of 2010 when they dove into Cauldron Lake for the first time. Or is it an ocean?                            
85	                                Alan Wake Remastered is a great game with capital letters and a perfect opportunity to enjoy it if it once escaped you. A horror adventure that moves the strings of psychological power like no one else, exploring the fears that we have in our heads.                            
85	                                Alan Wake Remastered is the perfect way for PlayStation 5 users to experience the story of Alan Wake. However, players looking for a refreshing experience might find themselves with a bit too much of the same thing that's been seen in previous versions of the game. At the end of the day, I am recommending this game for what it is over what the remaster offers.                            
84	                                Alan Wake: Remastered, although a bit didactic in the narrative and frayed in the gameplay, is still an entertaining video game full of charm.                            
82	                                Alan Wake Remastered is exactly what it says in the title, and that is a good thing. Alan Wake has received a thorough and clean remaster that doesn't compromise its original look and vision but enhances the gameplay by using all of the PS5's central features, including fast loading times and DualSense feedback. Its story and gameplay, while not perfect, still hold up well today. There is no story-driven game quite like Alan Wake, and being able to revisit this Xbox 360 classic on the PS5 is a dream come true — especially since this likely means that we will get that long-promised sequel.                            
80	                                This PlayStation debut is a straightforward remaster of the original, faults and all. But we still love it. [Issue#8, p.84]                            
80	                                Maybe not as impactful as the original was 11 years ago, Alan Wake Remastered still manages to keep what gave it a cult status. Crisper graphics do take away bits and pieces of the atmosphere built on foggy, dark and smudgy visuals, but also breathe in some new life. Almost as amazing as it was when it was originally released, this remastered release is a game you should undoubtedly get if you are into the genre.                            
80	                                Alan Wake Remastered is an example of what can be a good remaster of a videogame without an abusive price, it fixes some of the main issues that prevented a good game to make sense in today’s standards. Its ideals and the writer’s story would easily fit in any period of the gaming history so if you haven’t played it, this is an ideal opportunity to do it and the best way to fuel the hope for a potential sequel.                            
80	                                Alan Wake Remastered isn’t a purchase that anybody already owning a copy of the original needs to make in its current state. Still, it is a very welcome release for PlayStation owners who missed it the first time. Apart from the faces, every aspect of the original has aged beautifully in the time since, and its twisty, American-literature-flavored plot still holds up as well. It would have been nice to see some of Control featured here, and the fact that American Nightmare has been left out is disappointing, but if you’ve never experienced this journey for yourself, it’s a perfect time to jump into the cold waters of Cauldron Lake.                            
80	                                Alan Wake remastered is a good upgrade, both for old fans and new. The new textures and the modernized lighting system make the game a lot prettier to look at. A pity the cutscenes are 30 fps locked and their animations a bit sluggish, though.                            
80	                                In short, a very pleasant return for those who had already finished the game at the time. A must for others.                            
80	                                Visual irritations aside, Alan Wake Remastered is really just a game I'm glad exists. This is the nicest-looking, best-realized version of Remedy's 2010 title, and it holds up today just as well as it did when it originally appeared on the Xbox 360. If you're sitting on a copy of Alan Wake on PC, this is an upgrade you can probably skip--though the enhanced visuals are nice, they likely don't represent a big-enough change to warrant snagging a whole second copy of the game.                            
80	                                If you’ve never played Alan Wake before and love spooky games with strong stories and plenty of action, consider this remaster a must-have. Thanks to its upgraded visuals, ardent Alan Wake fans are likely to want to pick it up, too, and they won’t be disappointed. This is a game that has stood the test of time, and now being available on more formats than ever before, it’s time for it to step into the light and truly be seen.                            
80	                                Alan Wake Remastered easily stands on its own among modern, similar games due to its exceptional design, tight execution, and handful of technical improvements.                            
80	                                After finding out how deep the dark water goes, Alan Wake left us with not a lake, but an ocean of questions. And revisiting the Bright Falls through Alan Wake Remastered feels like a great way to read a certain old and dusted manuscript. Especially now, when the writer's journey through the night will seemingly continue at last.                            
80	                                Alan Wake Remastered marks the debut of Remedy Entertainment's iconic action shooter on all platforms more than eleven years after the famous Xbox 360 exclusive. Featuring the original campaign, two DLCs and some little extras, the game runs at 4K and 60 fps on next-gen consoles, replacing a large number of assets, textures and effects.                            
80	                                An uneven action experience gets by on a huge amount of charm and a gorgeous visual treatment that more than holds its own ten years later.                            
80	                                But even if you miss all of that beautiful metatext, Alan Wake remains a tense thriller that will keep players on the edge of their seats and is a testament to how sometimes less can be more, even in relatively big-budget game designs. Alan Wake Remastered presents an opportunity for a new generation of players to experience a gem that never got its due, and they'd be foolish not to take advantage. Still, they may want to keep on the lights when they do.                             
80	                                Alan Wake Remastered is still a fantastically playable game a decade later. With updated visuals, all the DLC, and some small tweaks, it’s a chance for newcomers to find out what the fuss was all about, and for fans to conveniently play a classic through again armed with knowledge from the more recent games in the developer’s oeuvre.                            
80	                                While not dazzling as a remaster, the core Alan Wake experience holds up well.                            
78	                                An excellent opportunity to rediscover one of the most popular stages of Remedy's journey in the industry, waiting for the developer to enlighten us on the future of its intriguing shared universe.                             
75	                                As a big fan of the original, the announcement of Alan Wake Remastered was a pleasant surprise. And while I enjoyed my time with it, I can’t help but feel like this is merely a tiny taste of what’s to come. Veterans of the franchise won’t find any reason to go back, and if they do, they may even find that the memory of playing Alan Wake is better than the game itself. Newcomers will find a lot to love; however, granted, they can grind through its annoyances.                            
70	                                A graphical facelift will be appreciated by fans, and make it easier for newcomers to experience a cult classic. However the game itself has not been improved and shows its age across its dull repetitive combat, stilted animations and decade old ideas. The Remaster doesn’t shed new light on a game that might have been better remembered remaining in nostalgic darkness.                             
70	                                A nice new coat of paint for Alan Wake, and the gameplay doesn't change a bit for better or worse. An unforgettable experience even now, but might be that your memories of the game itself are embellished and Alan Wake did age a bit.                            
70	                                Alan Wake Remastered is a fairly inessential upgrade for existing fans, but this moody mystery is still well worth a look for newcomers.                            
70	                                Alan Wake is very much a product of its time. While its story elements hold up well, much of the gameplay feels dated when compared to the games of today. This engaging narrative will only take it so far, as cumbersome controls and repetitive, paint-by-numbers gameplay mean at times, players may be left a little bit bored or frustrated.                            
60	                                For existing fans, this no-frills remaster is the best way to experience the 2010 game on modern consoles, but in 2021, much of the title simply doesn't hold up. Without the benefit of nostalgia, Alan Wake doesn't work as horror because it's not scary, as a thriller because long stretches of the game are fantastically boring, or as an action game because the combat is uninspired and repetitive. There's an interesting central mystery here, but like Alan Wake himself, you'll have to go through hell to find it.                            
50	                                The original was always highly simplistic and repetitive, and neither the passage of time or being in 4K can do anything to improve this disappointingly trivial actioner.                            
94	                                Lost Judgement is in my eyes a superb addition to the Yakuza series and is jam-packed with content. The graphics are great, the voice acting is great and the amount of activities that will distract you from the main quest is mind-blowing. It used the same formula which made its predecessors so much fun to play and improved on it. Even as dark and gruesome as the main story is there is always something around the corner in this game to put a smile back on your face.                            
93	                                Lost Judgment is a perfect sequel that improves and expands on everything the first part had. Next-gen graphics, along with flawless performance, act as the pillars of a thrilling story that dares everything, as well as fast-paced and fun gameplay.                             
90	                                Lost Judgment is a phenomenal improvement over its prequel and becomes a must-have for all Yakuza series fans out there.                            
90	                                By building on the first game's strengths and taking confident steps forward in some key areas, Lost Judgment delivers an arresting and captivating experience that surpasses its predecessor in every way possible.                            
90	                                Yakuza games have been arriving thick and fast over the years, but Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio still hasn't lost its touch. It's hard to think of another series with such regular entries that manages to constantly evolve at this level. While most don't add too much to alter the formula, Lost Judgment throws just about everything it can into its world without feeling over-saturated. With the main story, side quests, school stories, mini-games, exploration and other distractions, it's hard not to be impressed with what's on display. There's still an element of hold handing in the detective sections we'd love to see worked on and the lip-syncing may not be the best, but the team's first attempt at delivering a simultaneous worldwide release for the series is a gamble that has paid off and perhaps offers the best entry in the franchise so far.                            
90	                                For those who have played and enjoyed Judgment, the decision to pick up Lost Judgment should be a no-brainer. With a brand new story that's just as engaging (if not more so) than the first, as well as many gameplay improvements and a bucketload of new content, it's a fine example of a sequel done right. It's like a lucky dip where every time you load it up to play you're never sure what you're in for – but you'll rarely, if ever, be disappointed. Variety is the spice of life, they say, and Lost Judgment might just be the spiciest game I've played this year.                            
90	                                Lost Judgment delivers another fantastic thriller that ups the ante when it comes to its intricately woven plot and interesting cast of characters, all while making you question where the line is drawn between the law and true justice. And when all is said and done, you can sit and celebrate with some sushi.                            
87	                                Lost Judgment is a huge game with a storyline that will keep you glued to the screen and seasoned with a fast, frantic and spectacular gameplay and some very enjoyable mini-games. Recommended both to those who were already fans of the series and to those looking for a game with a strong narrative impact but without sacrificing fun gameplay.                            
85	                                An enthralling murder mystery with mature themes makes Lost Judgment one of the best narratives in the series. Yagami and his cohort are in their element as detectives and lawyers doggedly pursuing justice and truth, so much so that its relatively easy to overlook some of the tonal dissonance with the side content.                            
81	                                Lost Judgment is a good sequel to an amazing predecessor. The fighting system is fun, the mission design is very diverse, and you can still put hours into entertaining optional stuff within the vast open world. There is just one thing that makes a huge difference. Takayuki Yagami's new case is not in the least as personal and captivating as his first one. That doesn't make Lost Judgment a bad game, but it makes it clearly stand behind the first part of the spin-off series.                            
80	                                Lost Judgment on Xbox feels like a misstep in comparison to the plot of its predecessor, but it still stands head and shoulders above most other open-world titles.                            
80	                                Lost Judgment is a great mystery game with the signature Yakuza flair. If you're a fan, or even if you're not, you'll have a fun time with this game despite its dark subject matter.                            
80	                                If you need additional proof that developer Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio is a master of its craft, then look no further. Though slightly flawed in places, Lost Judgment is, nonetheless, yet another deeply compelling detective story, brimming with murder, mystery, intrigue, and more twists than a bag of pretzels.                            
70	                                If nothing else, Lost Judgment proves it would be a great shame if he didn't get another opportunity to find his niche. [Issue#365, p.112]                            
70	                                Lost Judgment is more of the same, which isn't a particularly bad thing. Although it presents improvements compared to the previous game, it remains too faithful to a formula with a solid base and a lot of room for improvement, especially in the investigative department. Even so, it’s still a fun experience, especially for fans of the first game.                            
70	                                While I really enjoyed Lost Judgment, the mishandling of some of the core, and incredibly sensitive themes really did reduce the experience. I still think it's a good game, but my feelings about it have definitely diminished since the opening hours, which I'm rather disappointed about. Still, if you like the Yakuza series and its spin-off games in general, you'll probably love this.                            
70	                                Despite its intriguing whodunnit premise, Lost Judgment’s main story fails to sustain its suspense all the way to the finish and its detective methods remain only slightly less superficial than those of the previous game. However, its meaty undercover side stories set in and around the Seiryo High School kept me playing for hours and hours well after the main story credits had rolled, in doing so revealing a lot of fun surprises that I might never have found had the classroom cases not kept me on the hook. This Yakuza spin-off feels far from being considered case closed, but here’s hoping that Sega can show some better Judgment in the series' future.                             
60	                                Lost Judgment is a bittersweet event. The story aims for a mature tone but is too often a macabre, morbid misfire that strays too far from the balance between silly and serious that the series is famed for. It's not a poorly developed title, though; the outrageously brilliant combat and sandbox distractions are clear evidence of that. It just struggles to tell the sort of meaningful, believable and sensitively weighted story that players have come to expect from this talented team.                            
90	                                There’s nothing like Actraiser Renaissance‘s seamless genre-blending, and the surprising depth in each facet makes the game all the more timeless. The extensive main campaign is followed by newly added post-game content that keeps the surprises coming, including an additional area to develop and a score mode. The ways to approach Actraiser Renaissance are as boundless as the content it provides, making it a revival that is well worth experiencing.                            
90	                                The original Actraiser achieved cult classic status back when it first debuted thanks to its unique premise and gameplay. Fortunately, the promised Renaissance is able to more than give this gem another look for those who understandably missed its decades-old launch, and Actraiser Renaissance is an exciting, engaging experience in 2021.                            
90	                                Overall, Actraiser Renaissance stays true to the original game, while building it out even further and keeping the essence of what made it so special intact. If you never played the original Actraiser, then you are definitely in for a treat as it’s not every day you don the mantle of the Lord of Light and defy the will of Tanzra.                            
90	                                ActRaiser Renaissance is a meticulously crafted remake that genuinely improves on the original game in several respects while maintaining the spirit of what made it special in the first place. The simulation and tower defense elements are instantly addicting, and the sidescrolling sections really make you feel like God has come down to smite the wicked. ActRaiser Renaissance is almost the best-case scenario for a remake.                            
85	                                Not everyone is going to think that way, clearly. Each individual has their own expectations for a remake, and Actraiser Renaissance may have put hands on facets that were once sacred. Some will find the changes intrusive. It would have been nice if there was a classic mode included that strips out the tower defense to make everyone happy, but that’s not in the cards. In my eyes, however, Acraiser Renaissance was one of the biggest surprises and the most enjoyable gaming experiences I’ve had this year.                            
80	                                ActRaiser Renaissance is the definition of a pleasant surprise. From its sudden launch as a Nintendo Direct shadowdrop to its refreshing revival of the game, it’s the epitome of the unexpected. It respects the original game. Yet, Sonic Powered and Square Enix built it up to ensure it does even more in a way that doesn’t feel forced. Both people returning to it and those experiencing it for the first time could equally enjoy it. And one can only hope Square Enix will keep in mind what worked here and make any other SNES remakes as robust.                            
80	                                Some of its new ideas could use a bit more hammering out, and I’m not sure it needed as much expanding as it has received. But it, like the game it is based on, is a rather unique game that pulls you in powerfully the more time you spend with it. There isn’t a whole lot like this out there, and it’s handily better than other homages like SolSeraph.                            
80	                                While the updated graphical style and jerky scrolling don't make a great first impression and there may be some who feel the 'Tower Defence' sections are given too much screen time, Actraiser Renaissance is ultimately a successful attempt at updating a solid-gold classic from yesteryear. Rarely are two totally different gameplay styles fused this effectively, and the enhancements introduced by developer Sonic Powered really do improve things; combat in the action sections is more fun, while the 'God Sim' portions of the game are lent increased depth thanks to thoughtful gameplay upgrades. To cap it all off, Yuzo Koshiro's music – available in both its SNES and rearranged forms – is masterful. While it's not perfect, Actraiser Renaissance will nonetheless find favour with fans of the original, as well as pick up plenty of new fans along the way.                            
78	                                Actraiser Renaissance is a game with good ideas and a solid foundation for the new content, but it fails to deliver an experience that matches the divinity of the original SNES title.                             
78	                                Actraiser Renaissance is a skilfully made remake, but it does suffer from a couple of major technical and stylistic uncertainties. If you love Actraiser I recommend giving it a chance: the strategic portion has been significantly expanded and even those who know the original by heart will find new elements to play with.                            
70	                                An unexpected gift for fans of the SNES original and while the remake is seriously flawed in terms of both graphics and gameplay its sheer oddness is still highly compelling.                            
70	                                Actraiser Renaissance is certainly a pleasant trip down to memory lane but not all modernization works as it should.                            
60	                                Actraiser Renaissance certainly is a SNES remake for better or worse. The 2D parts of this game have been remade poorly in regards to mechanics and visual fidelity. The gameplay loop of varying between action platformer and city-building sim did get its hooks in me but will be a harder sell for others. While it proves difficult to remain a strong recommendation, there are nuggets of character dialogue gold in there that are worth seeing through. On top of that, the visuals and music that come with these moments are special and remain evident why this is such a cult classic. If all else, I’m glad I got to check out a deeper cut in the Square Enix catalogue. Flaws and all, it’s at the very least got some heart.                            
60	                                Despite all the flaws, I still ploughed through Actraiser Renaissance, because, well, I love Actraiser, which is about the best that can be said for it.                            
52	                                While the core mix of action platforming and city building is a thing of beauty, this Renaissance version of ActRaiser is bogged down by motion sickness-inducing framerate drops, ugly prerendered character models, and far too frequent tower defense sections. If ActRaiser Renaissance is your only way to play ActRaiser, then please do yourself the favor, but I would highly recommend getting a Super Nintendo with a game cartridge, or a Wii with the virtual console download installed.                            
50	                                Actraiser Renaissance, however, is a remake that should have simply stuck to the basics that made Actraiser great. Instead, what you get are moments of greatness broken up by far too many moments of mediocrity.                             
95	                                For those who prioritize combat, you may be left frustrated. But I prioritize a beautiful world, wonderful music, magnificent platforming, and phenomenal tech. And on those grounds alone, Kena: Bridge of Spirits is a triumph, an utterly brilliant experience. And when each of those parts are this good, this lovingly crafted, this polished, it’s incredibly difficult to ignore. Ember Lab have created something truly special. This is a gem. Kena: Bridge of Spirits is the best game I’ve played all year. And you should play it.                            
90	                                From the very first moment till the very end of your journey, Kena: Bridge of Spirits is a heart-warming experience and a real pleasure between the visuals, puzzles and combat. Atmospheric music, beautiful lively graphics, believable heroes and cute little Rots - each little element is woven into the amazing whole that is the gaming experience provided by Kena.                            
90	                                Kena: Bridge of Spirits is a strong game, it’s a contender for game of the year and it’s ultimately one well worth playing. It’s a stunningly astute and whimsical take on death, life, and where we fit in all of it. The game is about Kena finding her place and helping others find there’s too. Beautiful, immersive, and dynamic, I can’t recommend this game enough.                            
90	                                The compact game plays consistently excellently, because no gameplay element seems superimposed and the feeling of progress is so successful precisely because Kena focuses on the essentials. Only on the story level was I left a little disappointed. The game makes an effort to touch the player emotionally, but it didn't really work out because the story and characters are shifted a little too much into the background. Nevertheless, the gameplay and presentation are so successful that they easily carry Kena over its ten to fifteen hour runtime and keeps me waiting eagerly for the studio's next project.                            
87	                                Kena: Bridge of Spirit is quite entertaining with its ten to fifteen hours, but every minute is worth it. In contrast to many other action adventure games, Kena manages without annoying side quests or an overloaded game world. It's like balm for a battered gamer's soul that is tired of big open worlds and trivial tasks.                             
86	                                Kena: Bridge of Spirits is "to the point": visually it's a feast for the eyes and with an interesting percussion-based musical score. It's fun, thoughtful, made with care and inspiration, even if it doesn't offer anything original in its individual areas. Especially considering that this is Ember Lab's first effort, the future is bright, and we can already imagine an even better sequel.                            
85	                                With a charming and nice adventure, Kena Bridge of Spirits invites us in a cute and dark world. The gameplay is rather simple but offers interesting mechanics that allow you to have a good time no matter what happens. With tons of resources to collect and an original scenario, Kena is clearly the kind of independent title that you want to finish. And this is perhaps its biggest strength: a relaxing game, with a challenge, that you want to finish at 100%. In the end, Kena doesn't invent much but offers a beautiful and memorable journey.                            
80	                                While we might have to arguably wait for future games to unlock the series’ true potential, Kena: Bridge of Spirits is still a great first outing for Ember Lab. If the breathtaking visuals don’t suck you in, then there’s the satisfying and challenging combat as well, or the wide world to explore. Or maybe you just want to find all the teeny hats for the Rot in order to make them as ridiculously adorable as possible. Whatever the case, there’s going to be something satisfying for everyone here in Kena’s debut.                            
80	                                Kena: Bridge of Spirits is gorgeous and extremely well made, but there's less heart here than I was expecting. It's still a worthy adventure with great controls and lots to see and do, though.                            
75	                                Despite its important shortcomings, Kena: Bridge of Spirits is a game that can be enjoyed by players who love the genre with its artistic aspect, animation structure and atmosphere.                            
71	                                Kena: Bridge of Spirits is a title of high artistic value, but one that stumbles in gameplay. It's got charming characters and setting, a decent story and great looking cutscenes, but actually playing through the experience is largely underwhelming.                            
65	                                Looks better than it plays, but it's got a good heart.                            
92	                                Jurassic World Evolution 2 exceeds all our expectations, improving the behavior of dinosaurs, adding more space to build and challenging scenarios that take us to iconic moments from the movies.                            
90	                                Jurassic World Evolution 2 covers all its bases in the newest iteration of the franchise. Aside from a few clunky issues when designing, every detail was considered and the game will appeal to a wide range of gamers, not just fans of Jurassic Park or Sim games.                            
80	                                 If a few additions strengthen the depth of the game a little, such as scientists or territory management, others are a little more cumbersome without being unduly disturbing. If we would have liked more clear-cut news, we once again had a great time on Jurassic World Evolution 2, for a good twenty hours.                             
80	                                There’s still room for improvement, a Jurassic World Evolution 1.999 by my calculations, but even with its issues, Jurassic World Evolution 2 is a fantastic sim game that’ll have you coming back for more, even when you’ve exhausted its campaign and Chaos Theory mode. It’s an absolute must if you’ve got the remotest interest in Jurassic Park, dinosaurs or unleashing nightmarish giant lizards upon an unsuspecting public.                            
80	                                While Jurassic World Evolution marked a rock-solid dry run for Frontier's prehistoric theme park management sim, Jurassic World Evolution 2 is a meaningful, erm, evolution, with the new Chaos Theory mode providing engaging scenarios in which you can attempt to set things right. A diverse suite of modes and slick interfaces ensures Jurassic World Evolution 2's status as an excellent sequel.                            
80	                                Jurassic World Evolution 2 certainly has a fitting title, because it's exactly that — a true evolution. The campaign might be a little on the short side, performance problems are unfortunate, and only having a handful of the movie actors reprise their roles can feel a little jarring (the Chris Pratt soundalike is kinda terrible). But rustling beyond the foliage of these superficial issues is a simulation game with the kind of depth and nuance that the original game promised but never really delivered. There's plenty to try out across its smattering of modes, with everything you unlock during regular play feeding back into the Sandbox mode, giving you even more options to mess around with there without limits. Certainly one of the better games of its ilk, especially on console, and while it can still get a little intense by genre standards, it probably wouldn't be a very good Jurassic Park game if it didn't.                            
80	                                Jurassic World Evolution 2 makes as many giant steps forward as it does back but has enough going for it to deliver a fun and rewarding theme-park experience. Like its predecessor, Sandbox Mode is the most fun, and this avenue of play combines everything the player has unlocked while removing all of the stresses. Collecting every dinosaur takes time and effort, but it's worthwhile, especially since you can experiment to see what happens when every dinosaur roams freely in the same space.                            
75	                                If the first chapter of the series represented a novelty and a small gem in the managerial games universe, this sequel expands and enriches the experience but it loses the opportunity to deepen the management component. It is an evolution of the first chapter, with new content and modes, but without adding substantial new features to the game formula.                            
70	                                A bit more complex, a bit more polished, Jurassic World Evolution 2 is a typical follow up for the first game, with just what is needed, no more, no less. A title that remains a bit weak compared to the norm for this genre.                            
70	                                If you loved the first Jurassic World Evolution, and have been chomping at the bit to play more new experiences, Jurassic World Evolution 2 will go down a treat. It’s the perfect follow up in a way that expands on what was good with the first game and offers new styles of play and narrative scenarios that really help it feel fresh. The comparisons to the original bring all the good and the bad from that first game, so anyone who’s played it knows exactly what they’re getting themselves into. I just wish the visuals were as polished as its predecessor.                            
50	                                If you have the first game then I am seriously struggling to find persuasive reasons as to why you should spend your money on this one. I strongly believe that if all of the effort that was put into making the other modes had been put into further developing Challenge Mode, it could have been something spectacular. Instead, I’m left feeling like I played a half-finished idea that pulled heavily from the original game. If you’re new to the franchise then this is a good place to jump in, as there are a few quality of life updates to enjoy, as well as more expressive and reactive dinosaurs. If you’re a returning player however, I can’t recommend this sequel, as the minor updates don’t alter the gameplay enough for it to feel brand new.                            
50	                                There’s genuine fun to be had with Jurassic World Evolution 2. Chaos mode and the sandbox give you a lot of options to really build the park of your dreams. When even the game’s best modes are fairly flawed, though, it becomes hard to recommend all, but the biggest Jurassic Park fans dig into this one. Players who can play on PC will almost certainly find a game that controls better, but while that’s an issue, it isn’t the only problem here. Sadly, a different control scheme isn’t going to solve Jurassic World Evolution 2’s most significant issues.                            
30	                                Quotation forthcoming.                            
100	                                Unpacking is proof that a pixel tells a thousand words. Through simple, zen gameplay and a startling attention to detail a story unfolds in this tiny, pixelated world in a way that just wouldn't have been possible in another medium. That's truly something special on its own – a wholly unique and original narrative experience – and the fact that it's wrapped up in an incredibly cathartic and tangible puzzle game makes it all the more praiseworthy. Witch Beam has something incredible on their hands with this one.                            
95	                                Unpacking is a satisfying, gorgeous and unexpectedly emotional dive into moving house and the importance of our possessions. This game simply must be played.                            
90	                                Unpacking was absolutely worth the wait. A delightful experience in every sense of the phrase, Unpacking will resonate with anyone who loves that feeling of fresh possibilities a new place offers. Even in its downturned moments, that unflappable optimism shines through, giving players a sense of excitement with each unpacked item. With its charming aesthetics, playful nature, and nuanced storytelling that will tug at your heartstrings, Unpacking unequivocally deserves a place in your game library.                            
90	                                Captivating, relaxing, cathartic, Unpacking turns a strenuous exercise in real life into a magnificent experience. Undoing the boxes at each stage of the main character's life provides a nice sense of accomplishment. Not in the layout itself, although it's always rewarding to pull off a Tetris with your possessions, but in understanding where the developers of Witch Beam are taking us and how. Without saying a word, delicately, with devastating attention to detail and a sublime atmosphere, the game tells us a very true story, which we easily cling to. The story of an invisible and mute virtual person whom we are happy to accompany and who, in the end, perhaps knows a lot more than we think about our own life.                            
90	                                Accompanied by wonderful pixel art and a soothing soundtrack, Unpacking rises from being a simple moving puzzle game to becoming a manifesto on environmental narrative, capable of teaching school for its incredible effectiveness.                             
90	                                Unpacking is the perfect game to unwind with and provides unique and cosy storytelling through its simple point-and-click mechanics that will keep players wanting more.                            
86	                                Unpacking is going to stick with me at least as hard as the latest superhero movie I saw, and it’s going to make the next time I need to look for a new place that much more tolerable. Maybe even fun. I enjoyed the brief time I spent with Unpacking, and I’m not going to stop thinking about it before my next move.                            
85	                                Quotation forthcoming.                            
85	                                Unpacking is a fun and entertaining little game that knows exactly its expressive boundaries.                            
85	                                Unpacking is disarmingly deep and surprisingly emotional. The journey opens by asking you to line up action figures and stuffed animals, and by the time it's over, you’re marking major milestones and surviving life’s most difficult decisions. The fact that it accomplishes this without a line of text or speech is really impressive. Just when you think you can predict which item’s next, you’re hit in the gut with a relic of unexpected meaning and charm. With a wonderfully consistent pixel aesthetic and a soundtrack that breezes by in the background, this is a gem that anyone with an affinity for interior design or inventive storytelling shouldn’t miss.                            
85	                                Unpacking has a simple presentation with some thought-provoking moments for players who are willing to immerse themselves in the experience. The story is straightforward, yet the method by which the player engages with it is so novel that it feels grander than it truly is. It’s a shame the abrupt ending left a bittersweet taste in my mouth. However, for a title designed to be played in one sitting, it manages to pack many different emotions into its short runtime, and utilize its medium so creatively that it has become one of my favorite games of the year.                            
80	                                I liked Unpacking very much. It’s complicated, but it’s as simple as a peanut butter sandwich, toasted in the sandwich press that you got three apartments ago.                            
80	                                A simple idea, near perfectly realised. [Issue#365, p.121]                            
80	                                Unpacking takes a simple and relatable task and turns it into a meditative and cosy experience that makes the art of environmental storytelling interactive. While the visuals, music and period items certainly make a tug for nostalgia, it’s the quietly revelatory story of the life whose possessions you’re unpacking, and the joy that it sparks, that makes it one of the best surprises of the year.                            
80	                                Unpacking is a delightful and charming puzzle game, one that perfectly takes a chore such as moving and perfectly shows how it can highlight the most important parts of our lives, allowing us to reflect upon them and the transitions we go through along the way. It helps that it also has terrific gameplay built around trying to find space by rearranging items as if they were blocks, all while telling a captivating story through each small bit taken out of each box. It’s an impressive little package that you’ll want to dive into.                            
80	                                Unpacking is an incredibly chill game. It’s exactly what you want to play when you need to decompress. There’s a place for everything, and it’s up to you to put it in that place. There’s no rush. Enjoy looking at what the person accumulated. Think about what certain items mean. Hope that they find happiness in each new place. Then, if you feel like you need to calm down or want to enjoy the art again, head back and do things different next time.                            
80	                                From the tiniest details in each item to the massive story told through simple gameplay, Unpacking is a fantastic indie game. The relaxing gameplay and chill music create a nice getaway experience. It's easy to disappear into Unpacking and complete the entire game in one playthrough, but the experience is so satisfying that players will want to do it again and again.                            
80	                                These little niggles aside, a stellar soundtrack from Jeff van Dyck helps to create a sense of calm and zen (that I can only maintain myself for one or two levels at time) as you continue to play voyeur and peek into the lives of the silent protagonist and their loved ones. The anxiety of moving prevents Unpacking from being something I would get stress relief from, but I nonetheless find myself returning again and again to continue its story.                            
80	                                Unpacking is a game about making a space your own, taking space up, and making space for others. Each of the game’s levels is a loveable snapshot of believable modern human life. Brisbane-based developer Witch Beam have made a delightful game that I know fans of Aussie indies have been looking forward to for a long time. It isn’t just a fantasy where I’m more organised than in my real life, it’s a relaxing, stress-free experience that I will definitely revisit.                            
80	                                Unpacking is something I play when other games are too stressful or busy to suit my mood. It's a concept I'd never have thought would make for such a rewarding experience, but beyond its simple premise is a story of interesting people and gameplay that inventively combines the homemaking of The Sims with the light-puzzling of a point-and-click.                            
75	                                Cute, charming, and surprisingly satisfying, Unpacking scratches an itch that no other game attempts. But it's also too bossy for its own good at times.                            
100	                                Age of Empires 4 builds greatly on the series' reputation that began in 1997. If you're a fan of RTS games, world history, or both, this should be an easy recommendation. With dozens of hours of campaign play, eight unique civilizations, hours of live docu-style video segments, and a ton of maps for skirmishes, there's no shortage of well-polished content to enjoy.                             
100	                                Age of Empires 4 is a bold and ambitious evolution of the series, and quite likely one of the best RTS games ever made.                            
100	                                A triumphant return for the strategy series, and well worth the wait.                            
98	                                I would not hesitate to recommend any RTS fan purchase this ASAP… the price is high… but this is unquestionably a title that earns the triple A moniker… you can really see the money invested in the production values and the polish. Even if you are just a history fan with a passing interest in gaming, I’d still say this is a must buy for the exceptional documentary videos throughout. I’d keep raving about it… but I have to mount my horse and fend off another attack on my castle!                            
95	                                Age of Empires IV isn’t something strictly for fans, there’s no accrued history you need to know before jumping in. It does however feel like a natural extension of Age of Empires II’s brilliance -- and for that does feel like the return of something great. What you’ve got here is a modern progression of the age-old, well, Age of Empires formula with all of the style and depth you could hope for. As a foundation for more campaigns, more maps, and more of everything to come it’s exciting. The documentary approach to the four campaigns on offer is not only a winner, but a confident step forward for the series. Historical warfare with an eye toward the educational. Age of Empires IV is not only one of the very best slices of real-time strategy gaming, period, it’s a candidate for best game of 2021.                            
95	                                Age of Empires helped define an entire genre, and under the steady hand of RTS masters Relic Entertainment, it may once again wear that crown -- Age of Empires IV is that good.                            
90	                                Age of Empires IV is a dream-come-true for all the fans of the franchise. It has everything we wanted, most of the things we hoped for, it is accessible to newcomers and challenging to the veterans. It is built with great attention to detail and obvious passion. If we sift the game through the finest sieve, we will find some issues here and there, mostly in graphical elements and in the slight hesitation of the devs to be innovative. We will do so, though, since we always ask for the best we can have and Relic is the one who can make it happen.                            
90	                                Age of Empires 4 is the perfect mix of old and new and I really think the legions of fans who’ve been waiting ever so patiently for 16 years for a new entry in this storied franchise will find much to love here.                            
90	                                Those expecting a revolution may be disappointed, but Age of Empires IV is still a confident, deep, and hugely compelling return.                            
90	                                Age of Empires 4 is an exemplary return of the great series to its roots and an excellent basis for future additions.                            
90	                                Age of Empires IV feels like some necessary fresh air that manages to maintain the essence of the classics without too much innovation. At the same time, it is actually a step forward towards what the community has been asking for in the last few years. The series is back with the utmost care by Relic Entertainment, displaying a commendable work like not many others. AOE is back once again.                             
90	                                Age of Empires 4 is a game that you will never get tired from playing, regardless of whether you're an old-school fan or a rookie. There are always new plans to follow and new strategies to take into account and it's worth the 16 year wait.                            
90	                                Age of Empire IV is everything a fan of the series could wish for: it renews the formula without overdoing it and respecting the past, it offers four unforgettable campaigns and the multiplayer is bound to shine. Welcome Back AOE!                            
90	                                A few months ago, Humankind was presented as a candidate to become the benchmark of turn-based strategy for the next few years. Now, with a similar love for the story, but with a different tone, Age of Empires IV arrives to reposition the franchise in the Olympus of RTS. A title that knows how to pick up and update the essence of the saga, and that is the basis of a resurgence that seems to have a long life ahead of it. If you like the genre, clear your diaries.                            
90	                                Age of Empires IV is, in almost every way, a true sequel to Age of Empires II. It plays great and has a few new features that add more tactical elements to combat and how you develop your faction. On factions, it truly allows them to differentiate themselves from each other. There are slight issues, such as the population cap that feels very restrictive and the lower-quality of unit models, but these are minor in what is an otherwise outstanding game, and one where an undeniable amount of effort and work has gone into - which includes hours of documentary-style clips to support the campaign.                            
90	                                Age of Empires IV is everything fans want and more. The great return of the RTS series is phenomenal                            
89	                                Age of Empires IV makes a safe bet putting all in on series' classic gameplay, with some new things here and there, but not risking a cent. If you're an all time fan of AoE you'll enjoy it for sure, but if you were one of those waiting for a revolution on the series, or at least a step forward, here you won't find it.                            
87	                                Despite some relatively minor issues, especially in the graphical compartment, Age of Empires IV is an excellent new chapter in the history of one of the most beloved RTS sagas. Relic Entertainment and World's Edge kept true to the roots of the series while at the same time not forgetting to innovate the formula in interesting and creative ways.                            
86	                                A well-crafted and complete title, capable of offering exactly what one expects from a modern RTS. While it has some weak points, like simplifying some of the series' core micromanagement, in the end it offers a solid experience which should not go unnoticed by fans of the genre.                            
86	                                Age of Empires 4 brings classic real-time strategy back in top form, but misses the chance for a rousing campaign.                            
86	                                Age of Empires IV won't shake the videogame world as much as its famed predecessors once did, but it's still a quality production from Relic Entertainment and a worthy addition to a legendary series of strategy games.                            
85	                                So Age of Empires IV is well put together and polished to high hell. I wish that something new had been done to bring the RTS genre that has been sitting more or less idle for a decade or so into the modern era, but you can’t have everything, and I suspect that more stuff like a map editor will be added in the future. Beyond that, with the recently released AOE2 Definitive Edition, that title, now 22 years old and $30 cheaper, already comes with a map editor that AOE4 lacks, and roughly a trillion player-made maps, and is probably the better bargain for your gaming dollar, especially if somehow you never got around to playing it previously.                            
85	                                Age of Empires IV does have it’s rough edges, especially regarding specific control and comfort options. Map editor and mod support are also still missing. But apart from that it’s already a very entertaining package with eight very different factions, nice mission design ideas, thrilling multiplayer and great insights for history enthusiasts.                            
85	                                Age of Empires IV is a solid RTS. It's fun, it's challenging, and it has a promising future. This is because the base is Age of Empires II, a mythical title that remains unsurpassed after so many years. Hopefully this greatness can be replicated, and in the future, Age of Empires IV will be seen as the cornerstone to advance into a new era.                            
85	                                Almost every element of the new Age of Empires made me remember how much fun RTS games used to be back in the day. I've played the remastered trilogy in recent years, but Relic's fresh approach has kept me up several nights trying to win potentially impossible battles against three enemies at once. And it's probably that enjoyment and the ability to lose myself in my favorite game that matters most to me.                            
85	                                Age of Empires IV is just what you would expect from it: It has a lot of content, game modes, and that addictive element that keeps you playing non-stop. The game doesn't offer many innovations, but they aren't necessary: the new, fresh, and modern presentation is just an excuse to enjoy this franchise once again.                            
85	                                Age of Empires 4 is a game that wants to do many things and has found the right compromise to do them all well.                            
85	                                With this new chapter, Age of Empires proves to be in good shape. We have an excellent foundation on which to build a strong RTS for years to come.                            
85	                                AoE 4 manages to modernise the series and be as fun as ever with a great new entry, even if it doesn’t reach the excellence of the classics.                            
85	                                Age of Empires 4 is a real-time strategy game of a scale we haven't seen in years. While it doesn't revolutionize the genre or the license, it does give them an excellent modern representative. The execution is almost flawless, the content is satisfying, the handling is fast, and the gameplay is satisfying. Novices and veterans alike should find something to enjoy, whether playing single or multiplayer. There is even an educational aspect, which helps to renew the interest and the look of battles and wars that we have already followed, or even fought in other games. Apart from a few minor flaws, as is often the case with very good games, we would simply have liked to have more.                            
85	                                Age of Empires IV is fun, well executed slice of real-time strategy that doesn't quite bring anything new to the table.                            
84	                                Age of Empires IV is another good example of the kind of strategy we miss. There are some technical problems in the game, but it's a really successful production.                            
84	                                Despite the fact that it's looking in the rearview mirror at least as much as it's looking forward, there's no denying that Age of Empires IV captures the addictive gameplay and mechanical accessibility of the earlier games in the franchise. It looks great, if not entirely new, and the flow of building, combat, research, and resource management is enjoyable as always. The documentary-style campaigns are engaging and immersive. What holds Age of Empires IV at arm's length from masterpiece status is its determination not to rock the boat, its slightly underwhelming feature set at launch, and some very minor annoyances from previous titles that really should be a thing of the past. Will I be digging deep into Age of Empires IV? Absolutely.                            
83	                                The real-time strategy genre remains relevant, fueled by a few big titles once in a while. While Age of Empires IV lacks any ambition to even gently jostle the standards set by Age of Empires II decades earlier, it’s a good way to play a classic-feeling RTS today with some slick polish and panache.                            
82	                                Quotation forthcoming.                            
80	                                Age of Empires IV delivers an absolute feast for strategy fans, offering several gameplay modes, a beautifully crafted story campaign, and stunning visuals. It may not come with a ground-breaking overhaul when it comes to its gameplay mechanics, but it does stay true to the tried and tested classic gameplay formula, which is sure to delight both old and new fans of the franchise.                            
80	                                Fans who have been waiting for more Age of Empires or a good RTS that doesn’t feel like it had to be developed on a shoestring budget will find what they're looking for in Age of Empires IV.                            
80	                                Age of Empires IV is a simple, pleasurable game that rewards developing high skill but does not require it to push and learn your way through.                            
80	                                Quotation forthcoming.                            
80	                                Overall, Age of Empires definitely brings enough to the table and captures enough nostalgia to make it an easy recommendation for any fans of the franchise or the genre. For gamers new to RTS, the Story Mode and campaigns actually make it a very strong choice for diving in as well, as long as they aren’t expecting cutting-edge graphics. The fact that the game is going to be available on Game Pass Day One could potentially help expose a large new audience to the franchise and build up some new fans. It will be very interesting to see what kind of reception it receives and, if its successful, what sort of post-launch content could arrive in the coming year to keep the community hooked and engaged.                            
80	                                If it is not free from flaws, Age of Empires IV is nonetheless a very good RTS and a very good episode of the license. By offering more verticality to players and interesting tactical choices brought by civilizations with more marked personalities, Relic Entertainment is bringing back the AoE license in a very nice way. Hopefully the pathfinding and AI concerns raised in this test - and by the players during the beta phases - will be quickly resolved, because it is only there that it will reach its full potential. Still, as it stands, AoE IV is an episode worth seeing, especially for its exciting campaigns.                             
80	                                Age of Empires 4 is clearly not a bad RTS. Considering the constant drought in the genre, the game is probably the best that could have happened for fans at the moment. However we wish the developers would have shown more courage. In the end the game is too similar to Age of Empires 2, it goes the safety route, not risking to do something wrong. And all of that without ever reaching the same atmosphere or charm that made the second entry so great. It is hard to think of reasons why a player who still has a lot of fun with the Definitive Edition of Age 2 should switch to this game. But whoever gets drawn by the small improvements like the new wall system or the gameplay differences between the civilizations can look forward to a great RTS package with many hours of fun.                            
80	                                Age of Empires 4 does more than play purely on nostalgia. It's a meticulous follow-up to the original trilogy with a range of options to tailor your RTS experience to your taste. Will it herald the comeback of the genre? No, it's not exceptional, remarkable, or innovative enough for that. It does satisfy the hunger of keyboard-mouse strategists that have been treated too stepmotherly.                             
80	                                In short, Age of Empires IV is first and foremost a throwback to the past, for a history lesson that we already know well. Anchored to the classic formulas and mechanics of the franchise that defined the genre, it bets on presentation quality to convince a new generation of real-time strategy game lovers. Veterans, on the other hand, have here a new battleground where they will certainly feel at home.                            
80	                                Age of Empires IV is an excellent return for the series and it feels like a base from which the series can grow again. I really hope future expansions follow the same model, coming packaged with well-produced documentaries, and with a similar focus of following the history of the period. Though, hopefully we'll see the team lean more into the special abilities and faction bonuses that are teased at in this base game.                             
80	                                Age of Empires IV makes up for the misstep of the third game while providing fans of the first two with everything they could have hoped for in a 2021 version. Hours will go by and you won’t even know it, which is the way RTS titles should be.                            
80	                                Age of Empires IV is clearly a very good strategy game, which should not disappoint fans of the franchise. With its graphical renewal, the focus on History and its very good artistic direction, we have in our hands a good entry of Age of Empires. However, we may regret that the game is a bit too academic and without any real risk. But still, Age of Empires IV is a very good game.                            
80	                                Age of Empires 4 has some technical issues, but they don't change the fact that this is a really good game. The campaign is interesting - I felt that the developers have made AoE4 with respect to its predecessors and still have managed to introduce some changes.                            
80	                                The strategic polish of two decades is on display in Age of Empires 4, both in the history of this series and the pedigree of the developer. Relic has wrapped an interesting if slightly flawed single player experience around what is a superb strategy game. You’ll probably know if you want to play this one, but if you just think medieval warfare is pretty cool and you really like the centuries where England and France just kept invading each other, I recommend you put aside any fears of fast clicking and micromanagement and just jumping in, just avoid that multiplayer menu until you are absolutely ready.                            
80	                                Newcomers may find it overwhelming, or slightly slow going in the early stages, but the campaign offers a great introduction to the genre, and the building blocks of Age of Empires. Don’t be surprised if you sit down to play a quick game, and then suddenly look at the clock to find that 3 hours have passed, your tea has gone cold, and the army that you’ve been meticulously building has been wiped by a garrison of archers you completely missed.                            
80	                                Age of Empires 4 is as multifaceted as the events it depicts. It’s more ambitious than other AoE games in handling its content and inspirations, but also far more reserved in changing the fundamentals. There’s no need to change what works already, though a few additional gameplay flourishes could have helped AoE 4 feel more fresh and exciting. The campaigns are robust, but the missing content stands out in its absence. That’s especially true considering Age of Empires 4 is a full-priced release, though being on Game Pass makes it a more appealing prospect. What’s here is still more than enough to be getting on with, but lIke any good strategist, World’s Edge is planning ahead for the long game.                            
80	                                Polishing a classic formula without revolutionising it, this is a robust package that includes something for just about every kind of RTS player, from beginners to grizzled veterans.                            
80	                                Age of Empires 4 is an enjoyable RTS throwback that often plays it too safe, but excels when it doesn't.                            
80	                                Age of Empires IV marks the Year 0 of a new era for the saga. Relic and World's Edge used the second chapter as a founding stone to build a new iteration which is half nostalgic and half innovative, shuffling the cards but never too much, creating a game that is appealing for both hardcore fans and complete newcomers. It might have some flaws, but it's really hard to imagine a better fourth episode.                            
80	                                There's a lot to love about Age of Empires IV. It's clear the developers have listened to the community in creating a game that feels both fresh yet faithful to the franchise. It has tried to combine the best elements of all previous games in the series and, largely, it has succeeded in doing so. Its small pool of factions may be a problem for some, and its camera issues need addressing, but in the grand scheme of things, this is an excellent entry into the RTS space. Is Age of Empires IV the best Age of Empires game to date? For me, it doesn't quite knock Age of Empires II Definitive Edition off the top spot, but regardless, this modern entry has undoubtedly been well worth the wait.                            
80	                                Age of Empires IV is a brand new, wide open door to the licence. The game adds new layers of epicness, but it strike somewhere between the hardcore fan who might not find everything he likes and the more casual gamer that maybe won't be attracted by its clacissim. It's a great game, just make sure it's for you.                            
80	                                An engrossing tapestry of warfare and scheming throughout the ages, Age Of Empires 4 firmly secures its position as a must-play for strategy fans. Full of sandbox-fuelled drama and interesting campaigns, the game captures the sweeping and costly scale of warfare in a way that few titles manage.                            
80	                                Age of Empires 4 is a deeply enjoyable return for the series. It puts history front and centre, and opts to refresh its gameplay instead of reinvent it. That may not be enough for some. Then again, when you’ve got a series that’s remained the base template for RTS games for more than twenty years, who can blame them?                            
79	                                It's that safety in embracing the past that represents Age of Empires 4's most obvious flaw. In many ways, it plays and feels like the game is simply Age of Empires 2 with a very well applied fresh coat of paint. Love letter or no, between the rough issues with the campaign and the reuse of the multiplayer, it feels more like a remaster of an older game than of a new entry into the series. It is not easy to please fans of the long-running franchise while also attempting to attract new ones to it, and Age of Empires 4 finds itself in a strange no-man's land between those two goals.                            
77	                                Age of Empires IV is an old school RTS that should be comfortable for returning players and accessible to newcomers. A bigger focus on historical campaigns is enjoyable, alongside great Skirmish and multiplayer modes.                            
77	                                A worthy new entry in the legendary series that’s equal parts progressive and dated.                            
75	                                Making Age of Empires IV a modern RTS without betraying the franchise's origins hasn't been an easy task for Relic Entertainment. While some players may blame the lack of risk taking, it must be recognized that disrupting the original gameplay could also have been taken badly. We are therefore dealing with an "Age of" classic in substance, but renewed in form.                            
75	                                Age of Empires 4 is a mixed bag for fans of the franchise. For Age of Empires 2 fans, this is an excellent, true sequel. For fans of Age of Empires 3 however, the gameplay might feel too slow and the diversity in troops is too low. History nuts can enjoy themselves with the campaign, but don't expect a challenge. If you are looking for a classic RTS however, Age of Empires 4 is a fine pick.                            
75	                                Age of Empires 4 isn’t a bad game at all. I had a lot of fun with it. Its biggest problem is that it plays it too safe. It wants to capture the success of Age of Empires 2 so much that it never really gained an identity of its own. I hope that in the future, the devs take the asymmetrical civilizations further and focus on mechanics that evolve the Age of Empires franchise. There’s a solid foundation here, and if built in the right direction, it could lead to something special. For now, it’s too old school for its own good.                            
75	                                Weaving a tried and true gameplay style with a historic documentary twist, Age of Empires IV reminds us not only how great the series once was, but how much better it can be going forward. Bringing back the excitement of real-time strategy, it keeps both the past and the future in mind - and with that, World’s Edge and Relic Entertainment have created an experience that fans of the original games will love, that is also accessible to newcomers of the series as well.                            
75	                                Age of Empires 4 does a lot well, building from the roots of the AoE franchise. Fans of the original games will find the improved graphics to be welcome and the gameplay to maintain the same fast-paced feel. History buffs will also find themselves delighted by the historical campaigns and the changing art style of the buildings as they progress through the ages. The only real downsides are the ease with which you can lose your rhythm, and the almost mandatory use of hotkeys in multiplayer due to bad pathfinding and unit AI.                            
70	                                I’ve enjoyed my time with Age of Empires 4 quite a bit, and I’d recommend it to any Age fan. But I wouldn’t do so without a few important caveats. Age of Empires 4 may finally be available after 16 years, but it hasn't arrived just yet. There are still resources to gather and troops to assemble.                            
70	                                Age of Empires IV is a satisfying game, but its more innovative ideas are overshadowed by a gameplay formula that rarely deviates from the revered legacy of Age of Empires II. Dated graphics, annoying AI, and a thin selection of content holds Age of Empires IV back from establishing an RTS kingdom that can stand the test of time, but thrilling campaigns, a passion for history, and factions that feel truly distinct from one another makes for satisfying RTS comfort feud.                            
70	                                A highly competent but disappointingly unambitious real-time strategy that fails to move either the genre or the Age Of Empires franchise forward.                            
70	                                It’s certainly a competently-designed RTS. Thanks to unique units, buildings and technologies, playing around with each civilisation is fun and offers a different experience each time. Unfortunately, with it feeling so similar to Age of Empires 2 but with many stripped down features, it’s extremely difficult for me to recommend spending £50 on this when you can grab Age of Empires 2: Definitive Edition for £15. Maybe it will be better after some updates, but right now it’s just reminding me of better games.                            
70	                                Age of Empires IV is a worthy return of an iconic series, but is difficult to recommend over older remastered entries. Newer players, and some returning ones, may find use of its new gameplay features but will probably end up scrapping them as they grow more experienced.                            
65	                                I understand that Microsoft and Xbox Game Studios would have been worried about Age of Empires III-style backlash, but they’ve gone too far to avoid it this time...Considering many casual RTS fans see Age of Empires as one of the stalwarts of the genre, and would return to play the game just for its fourth release, to see a new riff on the franchise’s 1999 title will disappoint many. I have the highest of hopes for the title ⁠— AOE II is, of course, a testament to how strong the series can be ⁠— but Microsoft has a lot of work to do to make Age of Empires IV its own beast.                            
60	                                Both longtime RTS fans and Age of Empires vets will find things to love here, a comfy if well-worn tactician’s armchair to slip into, spiffed up, and with a few shining surprises stuffed down the sides. But it all comes at such a premium, and with campaigns geared so heavily as tutorials for the multiplayer, it’s hard to wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone not already invested.                            
60	                                Age of Empires 4 is a safe new entry in the classic series. It is both nicer and bigger than before, but at the same time characterized by an extremely familiar feeling. The various playable civilizations are the triumph of the game, but the inherited problems from the rts genre as a whole do create some irritation.                             
60	                                Age of Empires IV is fundamentally a true AoE game, but sadly, it's very little else. There are no bold chances taken here, no great additions or revolutionary changes. And that, after so many years, is disappointing.                            
60	                                While there is nothing especially groundbreaking about Age of Empires 4's formula, it should manage to scratch a very particular nostalgic itch for fans and offer a starting point for beginners to begin their own journey through history.                            
90	                                While Voice of Cards could be refined as a game, the vision is impeccable, and while the game's not as outrageous or subversive as NieR and its sequel, it still represents Yoko Taro's unique qualities as a game designer and narrative writer: he is forever experimenting and pushing boundaries. Voice of Cards is almost subtle in this, but the way that it aims to work collaboratively with players to share a story, rather than tell it, is a delightful departure from the norm for the JRPG. I don't think anyone expected him to follow up NieR with a "card game," but Yoko Taro has hit onto something very special here.                            
80	                                Voice of Cards: The Isle Dragon Roars is a game that certainly won’t appeal to everyone; this is one that you have to come into with an open mind. It’s pretty short compared to most RPGs and doesn’t take many chances with its gameplay, yet the card aesthetic remains consistently interesting, it’s supported by extremely strong presentation, and that gameplay ultimately proves to be quite satisfying. For thirty bucks, this card game is one of the best concise RPGs you can buy on the Switch, and if any of its art or concepts pique your interest, we strongly recommend you give it a shot.                            
80	                                Voice of Cards: The Isle Dragon Roars is a great little gem to come out of this year. Where NieR is a good series though not quite for me, this absolutely is. The team have created a true sleeper hit that is well worth seeking out for NieR or fantasy adventure fans alike. The music and wondrous exploration on offer are engaging throughout. While other limitations in roleplaying are noticeable, they’re never enough to rob you of your enjoyment. What’s here is some clever and wonderful writing, a charming cast of characters and another weird world worth delving into. Yoko Taro and the team have done it again.                            
80	                                Voice of Cards: The Isle Dragon Roars is almost exactly what I was expecting from a Yoko Taro-led card-based RPG. That is primarily a compliment, as it still managed to take some odd turns and retained the somber, melancholy aesthetic of his past projects without sacrificing humor. Somehow, the games' all-card structure actually works within the confines of a traditional role-playing game, and it does it with so little fat that it never overstays its welcome. It also sacrifices some of the more jaw-dropping moments I want in a Taro game--what I expect most from him is the unexpected, and it's why Nier: Automata 2 is such a bad idea. But failing to make my eyes fill with tears as I contemplated the nature of my existence and the necessity of hope a second time isn't exactly striking out on three pitches.                            
80	                                Voice of Cards: The Isle Dragon Roars takes you on an epic journey through countrysides and dungeons with unique features. The game is just as charming as it is immersive, providing an unforgettable experience on the Nintendo Switch.                            
75	                                Without question, Voice of Cards represents a great entry point for RPG newcomers that employs a compelling and unique aesthetic. If you've shuffled your way through most of the RPGs on Switch, however, you might find this Isle Dragon more of a whimper.                            
74	                                Voice of Cards makes its particular staging its main highlight. The game remains a good RPG, but if you're numb to its aesthetic appeal, you can safely move on.                            
70	                                Voice of Cards is a neat little RPG that, thanks to its excellent presentation, makes for a fun experience despite a tedious encounter rate and boring dungeon design.                            
70	                                A great way to use cards for everything (playing and storytelling), while embarking on an old-school RPG adventure. However, Yoko Taro's magic is only found in small glimpses.                            
70	                                Voice of Cards is undeniably fun to follow, especially thanks to its frankly successful “board game” aesthetic. However, he fails to fully engage the player in his adventure, the fault of overly simplistic and intrusive fights. This leaves a very nice game, often funny and enjoyable to play, but unfortunately punctuated by moments of trouble.                             
90	                                Supermassive Games is responsible for the most compelling interactive movies around, and House of Ashes proves that the Dark Pictures Anthology is on solid footing after a divisive second entry. While it shares the same basic structure of the previous two games — a mismatched group explores an abandoned location, discovering the secrets of what happened there — it’s so wildly different in tone and theme that it feels nothing like the others. This was a big swing in a few different ways, and I’m glad to say that they knocked it out of the park.                            
90	                                The Dark Pictures Anthology: House of Ashes is easily the best of the series so far. There are clear improvements in gameplay, such as difficulty options and complete control over the camera, which help push this forward. The writing also takes strides forward, with an excellent cast of characters, more realistic writing, and a satisfying narrative throughout. Add the already exceptional abilities of Supermassive Games at building atmosphere, and you have a recipe for a great game - something that I firmly believe House of Ashes is.                            
85	                                While House of Ashes lacks polish thanks to an off-putting 360-degree camera and inconsistent visuals, these are likely to be fixed in the future – it’s just a shame poor Ashley has been done a little bit dirty in the process (and that’s not because she’s covered in blood half the time). All in all, House of Ashes is the standout of the series so far, and if the increase in quality is anything to go by, Devil In Me is likely to be the best entry yet.                            
85	                                The Dark Pictures: House of Ashes is a perfectly timed release. Put yourself into a Horror movie in time for Halloween and enjoy the thrilling ride.                            
80	                                In many ways, The Dark Pictures: House of Ashes is significantly better than its predecessors. One can even say that it's the most thrilling and action-packed offering from Supermassive Games. Unfortunately, it's also plagued by technical and design issues, as well as a borderline ridiculous twist.                            
80	                                The best thing I can say about House of Ashes is that its story didn’t make me feel betrayed in the end. There is no “it was all a dream” twist that creates a dozen plot holes, and it doesn’t pull away from the supernatural elements at the last second to reveal that the characters were hallucinating. Rather, it uses its monsters to connect together its themes and create a closed loop that only the best horror stories can effectively execute. For once it feels like The Dark Pictures bit off exactly as much as it can chew, and House of Ashes is so much better off for it. This is where I would recommend newcomers start with the series, and it's a great indicator that the anthology is just going to keep getting better.                            
80	                                The Dark Pictures Anthology: House of Ashes is another fun horror romp from Supermassive games. The game improves upon its predecessors by finally removing the fixed camera, and I found several of its characters to be endearing and worth caring for. Though it still falls into some of the same issues as past games in the franchise, The Dark Pictures Anthology: House of Ashes is worth playing if you’re a fan of the interactive horror/drama genre.                            
80	                                Great monsters, stunning locations and a quality mystery makes this one of Supermassive's best.                            
79	                                The Dark Pictures Anthology: House of Ashes is quite a jump in quality from other games in the franchise. The narrative development is attractive, the scenario is engaging, and the conclusions will give you goosebumps.                            
75	                                The Dark Pictures Anthology: House of Ashes is the most action-packed game in the series, at the expense of reducing the horror part. Players who love the genre and those who want to have fun with their friends should not miss this game.                            
75	                                House of Ashes does not distort the philosophy of Supermassive Games. While retaining the cinematic staging of The Dark Pictures saga, this third episode now offers a 360 ° camera and better integrated QTEs. Thanks to its controlled rhythm, its claustrophobic atmosphere and its interesting plot, it surpasses its predecessors despite its flaws (uneven writing, cartoonish characters, frozen shooting phases…). For anyone who enjoys interactive experiences of the genre, this latest iteration of the anthology is worthy of curiosity.                             
74	                                While House of Ashes takes a minor departure from pure survival horror, it manages to maintain its roots and tells a somewhat compelling narrative with a solid cast of characters. It's ultimately held back by a few technical issues and story loopholes that don't quite make sense.                            
72	                                A thrilling adventure for a couple of nights. You’ll probably see all of its major plot twists a mile away, but the clash with horrors lurking in an ancient temple is definitely worth your time.                            
70	                                House of Ashes comes close to “Until Dawn”-level quality, and for the first time after finishing a game in this series, it has me genuinely excited to see the next entry.                            
60	                                I have a lot of complaints about this game, but even with its flaws, I enjoyed it. I just think it could have been so much better. That being said, I’ve watched so many campy horror movies that have done much worse than House of Ashes. They might miss the mark on story elements and character decisions, but I can’t help but like the experience as a whole.                            
60	                                It's not a problem that House of Ashes tells a different story than the one I imagined. But a good story to replace it would have been nice. In the end, however, I was left dissatisfied, and the technical flaws are not even taken into account, they are added. With Man of Medan and Little Hope, I found it easier to forgive these stumbling blocks as the plot grabbed me more.                            
30	                                The Dark Pictures Anthology: House of Ashes is an utter disappointment and not the redeeming game developer Supermassive so desperately needed it to be. Where its accessibility options offer to draw more players in, just as many will be repelled by its poor and offensive political themes, shoddy camera handling, uninspiring cast and buggy nature. Hoping to be a thrilling ride with some political intrigue, it's instead a sloppy affair that'll leave players feeling like they're going through the motions. Supermassive fans deserve better. The horror genre as a whole deserves better. No recommendation can be provided for this dark plunge.                            
20	                                Nonsensical characterization is the order of the day throughout House of Ashes.                            
100	                                Alan Wake Remastered is a remasterpiece. I caught myself audiably saying, “man, I love this game” over and over while playing. I’ve dipped back in to Alan Wake’s American Nightmare to continue on, and I have a feeling I’ll be scheduling another replay of Control when this silly season quiets down. Remedy’s universe has captured my heart; Remastered certainly holds its own in 2021, but also serves as an impressive reminder of how far the studio has grown since 2010.                            
96	                                This title is a true example of a game being considered art. The use of loops, light vs darkness themes, the music and score, all whilst building a lovable cast of characters makes it a memorable game. I would consider this remaster a general success with the exception for PC, consoles seem to be running the game with only one serious known issue that should be fixed soon.                            
90	                                Alan Wake Remastered is the definitive version of Alan's story in Bright Falls. It is the exact same game that acquired quiet respect amongst fans and critics following its 2010 release. Only now it boasts 4K visuals and 60FPS gameplay. Along with some welcome bonus features, and packaged-in DLC, the remaster is a must for superfans, and a fantastic starting point for curious newcomers, with only a few small annoyances that stop it just short of reaching perfection.                            
90	                                Alan Wake Remastered is one of the most essential games this year. More than ten years since the original launch, Remedy's best game provides a mysterious and terrifying story, a dynamic gameplay that use the light as a weapon and the perfect environment that is Bright Falls. Plus, the magnificent work of remastering such an excellent game give us hope for a sequel that, maybe, arrives in a few years.                             
90	                                If you've never played Alan Wake, this is the best possible way to experience the game. For anyone who loves horror or Remedy's other titles, there's a ton to unpack here with an engaging narrative and stellar gameplay. The remastered enhancements bolster the game even further, giving it a place in today's gaming world, and while the gameplay doesn't perhaps hold up as well as it did in 2010, Alan Wake Remastered is still as joyous as it was back then and a perfect treat for the Halloween season.                            
87	                                Of course Alan Wake Remastered does not outbid the visuals of the current gen references, but Remedy does a great job bringing the graphics into the year 2021. Everything looks much better, sharper and more detailed, without distorting the special and intense atmosphere of the 360 original. Beside that, Alan Wake remains a great mixture of horror story and action with tactical light use and a huge dose of kaboom. If you don't know Alan Wake yet, you need to play the Remastered right now. If you are a fan of the original, the remastered version is a great opportunity to revisit Bright Falls.                            
83	                                Alan Wake Remastered brings back a true cult with renewed and valid graphics, with the plot that remains the highlight of the game and a gameplay that is still very compelling. Recommended especially for those who have never played the original title.                            
80	                                Alan Wake remastered is something I have always wanted to exist as the original was highly under looked when it came out. It was tied to one console and frankly Remedy was not quite the household name it is today. It is one of their best games and worth checking out whether you played the original or not. It still carries plenty of jank and questionable design mechanics from that era, but the story and characters excel it past most of its own issues. This is one experience that is worth revisiting or experiencing for the first time.                            
80	                                Alan Wake Remastered is the best way to rediscover an introspective video game that despite all these years is still fun to play.                             
80	                                In short, a very pleasant return for those who had already finished the game at the time. A must for others.                            
80	                                Alan Wake Remastered is yet another classic gaming experience that has been given a new lease on life. While the ongoing trend of remasters and remakes may slowly be becoming tiring or seem uninspired to some, there exists a handful of games in recent years that have reaped the benefits of getting a second chance to strike gold. As a new player coming into the series, I was incredibly excited for this remaster and I came away from the experience with my expectations met and surprisingly exceeded. To see a much-discussed game in the best possible light, means the things that matter to what made the game special back in 2010 remain so today. Remedy delivered a fantastic video game thriller over a decade ago and with the help of the team at d3t, it has done so again with even more polish and refinement than the original ever thought to possess.                            
80	                                Alan Wake is a fantastic game, while Alan Wake Remastered remains just a great port. Yes, it loses something with the new shiny visuals and a few things have not withstood the test of time, but everything else is still fantastic. Especially that story!                            
80	                                Alan Wake still shines in a modern landscape thanks to its unique story and intoxicating atmosphere, and the remastered visuals modernize it just in time for Remedy's inevitable sequel.                            
80	                                I waited more than 10 years to finally play Alan Wake, and now that I’ve seen the credits roll, I can’t get it out of my mind. It’s firmly sunk its teeth into me, and like with many of the other greats, I’ll be returning to this world again and again for years to come.                            
80	                                Alan Wake was and still is an occasionally bizarre action horror game, with some lovely set-pieces, fun combat, and what I hope is a slightly tongue-in-cheek sense of self-importance. I think it stands up remarkably well 11 years after its original release and this Remaster is the best way to experience what I consider to be a modern classic.                             
80	                                Alan Wake Remastered does what a good remaster should. It honors the original game’s artistic direction while enhancing it with modern technology, specifically in the form of volumetric lighting. Its lack of American Nightmare as part of the package is disappointing to say the least, but fans of Remedy’s current work would do well to take a trip to Bright Falls, whether they’re returning or visiting for the first time.                            
80	                                Alan Wake Remastered compiles a polished compilation of the original game and its DLC. A few more extras would've been nice but this is the best way to play through Remedy's horror adventure.                            
80	                                Alan Wake Remastered mostly improves on an already excellent horror shooter experience, introducing a genre icon to a brand new audience.                            
75	                                Alan Wake is still a good game, but the remastered version reminds us that this game comes from a different era, and I wish that the devs would have implemented some QoL improvements to cater for this current gen.                            
75	                                If you are a true Sony fan who never played on any other device other than PlayStation and you are wondering how things are on the other side, then Alan Wake Remastered is one of your best shots, even though it has its fare share if flaws.                            
75	                                Overall though, Alan Wake Remastered is the same game it was in 2010 but with slightly nicer looking graphics. If you enjoyed the original, you’ll most likely enjoy this. If you hated it, there’s nothing about this new release that will change your mind. And if you’re brand new to the series, it’s definitely the best place to start.                            
70	                                Alan Wake Remastered's improvements are subtle and won't dramatically change the experience, but that also means it retains what made it so special in the first place. The atmosphere is chilling ,and the story holds up after over a decade, meaning it doesn't need a full-blown remake to still feel worthy of a modern retelling. Even with its flaws, Alan Wake Remastered is worth playing in 2021, especially for those who missed it the first time around.                            
60	                                Writer Alan Wake searches for his missing wife while tackling a malevolent force disguised as darkness in this clunky but atmospheric reboot.                            
91	                                I was absolutely impressed by how much of a full-fledged racing game Hot Wheels Unleashed is. It’s right at home with some of the better arcade racers on the market today, and offers up a whole lot of fun for the whole family, regardless of whether you’re a Hot Wheels fan or not. The track customization is pretty solid, with a decent enough opening tutorial to get you started, and the sheer number of vehicles you can obtain right out of the gate is pretty impressive. The multiplayer could use a bit more fleshing out, but at least works great, and the game controls fantastically overall. If you’ve been in the mood for a new racing experience that everyone can enjoy, then look no further than Hot Wheels Unleashed.                            
90	                                Carefully detailed, highly customisable, and buoyantly uncynical, Hot Wheels Unleashed is a surprising and brilliant arcade racer.                            
85	                                A Hot Wheels Unleashed will free the collector in you with a game that mixes nostalgia and racing in high octanes.                            
83	                                Chock full of nostalgia and featuring a track creator that is second-to-none, Hot Wheels Unleashed is a must buy for anyone with a family that wants to race with or against each other.                            
80	                                Hot Wheels Unleashed is one of the best arcade racers to release on modern consoles in years. Tight controls and action-packed races make for a fun and satisfying racer that offers intense racing and a lot of ways to play.                             
80	                                In Hot Wheels Unleashed you get to drive, jump and slide around creative and demanding tracks. The races are short and intense, and the toy cars feels great to control. The gameplay lacks a bit variation though, and sometimes a second of bad luck can destroy all chances of winning a race. At its best though, Hot Wheels Unleashed can compete with timeless classics such as Ridge Racer 7, Micro Machines V3 and F-Zero GX.                             
80	                                A cracking little arcade racer from a studio better acquainted with motorcycle sims, Hot Wheels Unleashed is like sticking both hands into a big toy box of die-cast cars, pulling them all out, then thrashing them around a racetrack. And what is there not to like about that?                            
80	                                Hot Wheels Unleashed puts the brand to perfect use, marrying bright and bold toy car racing with powerful track creation.                            
75	                                Overall, I can look past the grind of obtaining new cars thanks to everything else Hot Wheels Unleashed does. I loved its commitment to the memory of racing around my bedroom floor, and for those looking for an accessible arcade-style racer full of personality and flair, look no further.                            
75	                                Hot Wheels Unleashed is a game that tugs at my nostalgia for collecting these cars. I just wish the aggressive DLC plans and grinding for new cars didn’t sour that experience so much. When I was playing I was having a blast. The track design and handling are superb and when I got a new rare car I was super excited. Hopefully they tweak some of the requirements for unlocking cars and I hope the season passes are not overly priced for their own good. I would love to see this game flourish and become a staple of arcade racers. It feels like a renaissance of the genre, and I want Unleashed to be there for a long time coming.                            
75	                                It’s no surprise given Milestone’s pedigree that Hot Wheels Unleashed is a mechanically sound and confident racing title as it boils down the true essence of Hot Wheels and puts on a showcase exactly why they’re a beloved pastime. The bloated story mode does little to obfuscate the game’s skeleton crew of modes, though I think the game will find resilience through a community of online racers and their wonderful, imaginative creations.                            
74	                                If you’re looking for a new way to jump into the world of Hot Wheels, Unleashed is certainly not a bad way to go, after all, we’ve seen worse in the series’ history. That said, the price point may prove steep for what feels like a more basic use of this beloved licensed property, and with very basic options for included game modes, a lack of substantial variety in race types, and no suitable way for the community to share their impressive track builds, it feels like Milestone has undercut themselves in a possibly rushed attempt to capitalise on this potentially fruitful racing franchise.                            
70	                                Hot Wheels Unleashed captures the magic of plastic cars with fast and smooth racing, but the toy box is a little shallow. There are numerous maps and cars, but the limited amount of environments, music, and set-pieces make for an experience that starts to get old quickly. As a result, Hot Wheels Unleashed rides the high of its racing, which feels like butter when drifting around corners and speeding through loop-the-loops, using whichever food truck or licensed car you pull out of the blind box, but doesn't bring enough of the license's personality over.                            
70	                                Gravity-defying loops and curves sit alongside integration with real-world sections and plenty of room for breaking race lines, if you’re the overzealous type. And the deeper you go into the game as it’s meant to be played, with fully upgraded cars, the more a hidden level of depth emerges and a truly challenging racing game materialises. It’s just a shame it’s largely hidden from the outset.                            
70	                                Hot Wheels Unleashed is a good addition to the world of racing games, with enough to make it totally unique but not too much to overcomplicate it. There are a few things I wish would make it feel more full, but for what it does deliver, it delivers it well.                            
70	                                Hot Wheels Unleashed is a decent racer with some excellent surrounding elements. It lacks the strategy and realism of a sim, but doesn’t hit the over-the-top chaos and action of an arcade racer either. Despite that, the amount of customization available, and with all of the cars to collect, fans of Hot Wheels toys will likely have a good time with Unleashed.                            
70	                                It remains an effective game, quite enjoyable and is without doubt the one that most faithfully respects the spirit of the famous brand, with that same nostalgic and passionate vision that we could have had ourselves, a few years earlier.                            
70	                                Hot Wheels Unleashed is a decent effort at bringing the iconic brand into the video game scene for real. It’s able to deliver a wide variety of cars and tracks to gamers in a way that is fast and frantic, seeing it occasionally verge on being a really great arcade racer. Physics issues and little minor annoyances stop this from reaching the very highest step of that podium, but if you’re a Hot Wheels fan, Unleashed is well worth a visit.                            
60	                                Fans of the toy line will likely find stunning digital recreations of the cars they love here, whether now or in one of many content updates already on the cards, along with a generally competent racer to use them in. Still, said fans may find that the dedication to the brand here elevates the experience to a degree, although those with less love for Hot Wheels in general might just see this passable racer as more of a slightly cynical vessel through which to peddle pretend toy cars for the next few years. Shiny and on-brand, but nothing particularly special, honestly.                            
60	                                I enjoyed playing Hot Wheels Unleashed a lot. The racing is straight up fun thanks to a top notch handling model that really makes the most of some impressive powersliding mechanics. But I can't help but wonder what could have been had we not got a game brimming with DLC and tied, to its detriment, to uninspired track environments.                            
60	                                Hot Wheels Unleashed gets its racing and assortment of cars so very right, but the way you go about unlocking more content is unfathomably restrictive and leads to frustration.                            
55	                                On the track, there’s a decent little racer in Hot Wheels Unleashed. Everything else feels like a bit of a letdown.                            
40	                                This is the kind of game a cheap uncle buys a kid for Christmas out of the bargain bin giving little thought beyond, “little Timmy likes cars so I’ll buy him this thing.” Sadly, it will only keep kids entertained for as long as it takes them to realise the odds are stacked against them. While some real passion has gone into the transition of some much-loved toys into digital form, the challenge of Hot Wheels Unleashed is just too great for its target audience. Without significant fixes, it will do little more than frustrate all who pick it up.                            
40	                                Hot Wheels Unleashed feels less like a cohesive racing experience and more like a framework where more and more Hot Wheels branded content can live as the months go on. This comes through not only in the lackluster presentation but in the currency system that robs players of any sense of urgency to complete missions. It doesn't feel satisfying to go through an hour of races and grind up currency to get a single box that contains a duplicate of an already-unlocked car. Instead of unlocking cars like heroes in Overwatch, the game operates as a video slot machine. While there's no way as of this writing to purchase currency with real-world money, the entire system feels tailor-made to support exactly that kind of philosophy. At that point, it might be a better investment to simply pick up some actual Hot Wheels and just watch them zoom around the track in real life.                            
91	                                You are not throwing the dice with Lost in Random because here the fun, the art and the originality are guaranteed.                            
85	                                Lost in Random is a unique mix between a card game and an action/adventure game. The development of the universe and the plot takes a little while to get started, but once you meet Par and his unexpected companions, you start to fall in love with his story in this strange world of Burtonian style. And we can not forget the humor that shines constantly, and the visual and sound section that does not disappoint. Its main problem is that the AI is not very challenging, and it lacks more variety in the cards.                             
80	                                Lost in Random is an original and engaging adventure, with an original combat system and a unique world that brings to life a dark fairy tale full of nuances and memorable moments. There are some flaws, but they are imperfections that minimally undermine the qualities of a game that undoubtedly deserves the attention of all fans of the genre.                            
80	                                Despite these hurdles, we hold no doubt they'll be ironed out in the coming weeks. What will be left is an underrated gem that has unfortunately slipped under the radar. Coming out the same week as Tales of Arise, Life is Strange: True Colors and Sonic Colors: Ultimate, the game appears to have been lost in the noise. It's a shame, but we're confident an audience will be found of people such as us who will love and embrace this game - warts and all. Lost in Random may not strike a chord with everyone, but for those it does, they will absolutely love it.                            
80	                                Lost in Random enjoys an exquisite universe, between an artistic direction reminiscent of the golden age of stop motion and a particularly rich narration. Add to that combat mechanics cleverly built and well executed despite some redundancies and some under-exploited ideas. But in the end, Zoink offers us a fascinating macabre tale that never runs out of steam over time and is worth browsing.                             
70	                                Lost in Random is a very unique game. It has great writing and some of the best art direction of the year. However, the combat system plays a risky gamble that I don't feel quite works out in the game's favour.                            
60	                                It's worth rolling on to the end, but you might find yourself wishing it had more of the concision of its cinematic inspirations, rather than the drag of a family game of monopoly. [Issue#364, p.123]                            
90	                                Quotation forthcoming.                            
90	                                As confusing as this might sound, Exo One is every bit relaxing as it is intense. Its exploration of the mysterious and deep reaches of space combined with its perfectly arranged soundtrack creates a different kind of sci-fi experience that should definitely be checked out by fans of the genre. As far as I know, this is Exbleative’s first title, but it’s an absolute banger. I’ll be eager to see future projects from the studio, science fiction-based or otherwise.                             
85	                                Intriguing and startlingly original, Exo One offers a quiet, meditative experience that's both foreign and mysterious.                            
85	                                Exo One is almost a perfect sci-fi puzzle game, let down by one poor level right in the middle. The movement, the beauty of its scenery, and the peculiarity of the narrative is something I really appreciate about video games as an art form.                            
80	                                A very powerful experience, which can be completed in less than three hours but capable of burning itself into your eyes and mind.                            
80	                                Despite offering a faster-than-light flight through the galaxy, Exo One‘s wider angle is a slower-paced and melancholy journey through a beautifully-realised cosmos. There are some issues with bugs, and the unhurried pacing won’t be for everyone, but Exo One is an unmissable voyage for those who know what they’re getting into.                            
75	                                Despite everything, a very nice adventure to discover.                             
70	                                Short and sweet but in no way significantly dented by its own strict vision and run-time, Exo One‘s picturesque voyage through one far-flung planet to the next, though not without fault, is more engaging and novel than it is mildly indulgent.                            
88	                                I didn’t think that Sherlock Holmes Chapter One would be something I would initially gravitate towards, but I’ve been converted once I felt like a genius after solving my first case, wanting to know more about Sherlock, Jon and his mother’s passing. Not being forced to find one ‘correct’ solution to cases was a breath of fresh air and I was completely content with the ending I received. While it’s not episodic, I’m hoping to get some form of a Chapter Two someday, as I want to see how my Sherlock evolved into the legend.                            
80	                                Quite possibly developer Frogwares’ most accomplished crack at the iconic detective yet, Sherlock Holmes Chapter One combines a compelling story, detailed world, and involving investigation mechanics to great effect.                            
80	                                Sherlock Holmes Chapter One is powered by a brilliant story and the chance to take in some superb cases. The ability to get accusations wrong and to choose whether to save or condemn is a solid touch that allows the game to deliver a great dynamic. There are a ton of hours included here too, with a huge main story and loads of side quests to take in.                             
80	                                It wasn’t easy following the extraordinarily ambitious The Sinking City, yet Sherlock Holmes Chapter One takes some of the best ideas of its predecessor and builds on them, combining it with Frogware’s experience with the Sherlock Holmes universe. The result is a game that can feel very rigid and linear at times but excels in the deep and emotional exploration of Sherlock Holmes as a character. The game is full of interesting and memorable cases, even if player decisions and agency barely matter. This game lives in the legacy of old adventure games like the Broken Sword series and if understood as such, this is a wonderful modern adventure game.                            
80	                                If you’re keen to test your cerebral matter then Sherlock Holmes: Chapter One will delight frequently. Occasionally clunky it may be, it’s still hugely satisfying and offers some compelling cases to solve. There’s some work to be done to make this the definitive Sherlock Holmes game but for now, revel in its wonders.                            
80	                                Sherlock Holmes: Chapter One is a title that comes excruciatingly close to achieving greatness. When you are in the midst of one of the many mysteries that Cordona Island holds, cracking cases and soaking in Frogwares’ fantastic writing, Sherlock Holmes: Chapter One is up there with the best the series has to offer. Unfortunately, performance issues hold back the open-world exploration to an extent that drags the overall experience down. Nevertheless, even with the technical drawbacks, the main gameplay loop of cracking cases and solving puzzles is stronger than ever and well worth the price of admission.                            
78	                                Sherlock Holmes: Chapter One is a good (re)starting point for the famous detective's video game saga. The mysteries this time are a bit easier, but there are many more contents than usual thanks to the new open-world approach even if the new features would have used a little more development. All in all, the new direction of Sherlock Holmes is definitely the right one and we're eager to see where it will lead in the future.                            
77	                                This is one of the best detective titles you’ll play and its story and voice-acting is a pure joy. Just don’t go in expecting any high level of visual sheen, or system fluidity.                            
75	                                For its ambitious prequel, Frogwares relied on an open world that enjoys a rather generous scope for a wide range of surveys. These also give the game a very solid lifespan. On the other hand, the proposal proves difficult to measure up on a technical level, with slowdowns, rigid animations and clipping in support. More engaging in its second part, Sherlock Holmes: Chapter One offers progressive dynamism and a commendable conclusion. The heart of the adventure lies in its clues to be connected and the accusations to be made, which follow a pattern of investigation which, however, runs out of steam too quickly.                            
74	                                I need a little more hand holding than Sherlock Holmes Chapter One gives. I’m not as smart as Sherlock, and found myself bumbling around at times like a lost child. When I was in the zone I was having a good time. The variety of costumes made for a fun time, and the eavesdropping mini game were a good distraction to a worthwhile story. The game has flaws, but those can easily be overlooked with a mountain of fun and interesting mysteries to solve.                            
70	                                Despite these issues, it's difficult not to get sucked into Chapter One's web of intrigue. The central mystery is uneventful until its final moments, but the cases surrounding it are consistently excellent, and the role you play in solving them is incredibly gratifying. The open world is more of a backdrop than anything else, but it expands the game with dozens of side cases that are just as alluring as those found in the main story. Sherlock Holmes: Chapter One may stumble at times, but it scratches that investigative itch like few games even attempt to.                            
70	                                Sherlock Holmes: Chapter One seeks to innovate by making the gameplay more free and complete. Truth to be told some  technical limitations, still the game remains a pleasant experience without highs.                            
70	                                Sherlock Holmes: Chapter One deviates little from the established Frogwares detective game template, but that doesn't stop it from being a compelling adventure and perhaps one of the studio's stronger games overall. It's got a meaty and intriguing core story, loads to see and do off the main path, and some swerving cases that will take some serious sleuthing to come to the right conclusions — I'm not sure what more you could really ask for from a game like this besides that tried-and-tested trifecta, except maybe a little more polish. The lack thereof doesn't hurt the game too much, mind, so if you enjoy solving crimes while being really, really, really ridiculously good-looking, this mid-price mystery should definitely find its way onto your wishlist.                            
60	                                Sherlock Holmes Chapter One presents an interesting set of mysteries to solve, but its open-world setting doesn’t really elevate its familiar investigation gameplay to a substantial enough degree, and its combat sections are uniformly dull and repetitive. There are certainly bursts of satisfaction to be earned when you get on a roll with an inquiry, but too often the vague case criteria can cause your sleuthing to stall and force you to fall back on guesswork, while the annoyingly unhelpful advice from Jon only makes these moments feel all the more frustrating. Sherlock Holmes Chapter One is a decent detective game set in an open-world that’s a bit too elementary.                             
60	                                There are a lot of things to admire in Sherlock Holmes Chapter One, and when it works, it all comes together in a fantastic new way. Unfortunately, there are far too many instances of clues that perhaps made sense to the team that made it, but not the player. Just when you start finding your stride, a roadblock appears as you struggle to figure out your next steps. The jump to an open-world setting ultimately feels unnecessary and adds to the confusion. Sherlock Holmes Chapter One is not a bad game at all, but the experimental gameplay feels like a missed opportunity that a sequel could perhaps refine.                            
90	                                Happy Home Paradise gave me a lot of freedom to make choices then act on them without too many repercussions. Ultimately, I could do what I wanted and when I wanted (within reason). I like New Horizons, it’s a good game, but there is a limit on what I can do without needing to spend a lot of Bells or spend hours grinding for one simple change which could end up being a mistake. In contrast, The DLC thrives by offering players total control over their designs, and by setting the stakes low. From designing an entirely pink house for a fabulous Flamingo to remodelling the Cafe into a 50’s style Diner, there were few limits on my designs or on the potential to have fun.                            
90	                                Happy Home Paradise makes Animal Crossing: New Horizons feel like a 'definitive' edition, especially when considered alongside the substantial free additions of version 2.0. It's beautifully polished — and that's not a reference to the ability you earn here — and provides even more variety and depth to your daily AC island life. You may discover new villagers to call friends, and perhaps even learn a little about how to better decorate rooms and homes. Most importantly, it simply makes us smile — that alone is the best recommendation we can give.                            
85	                                Happy Home Paradise is the answer for those feeling fatigued by Animal Crossing New Horizons.                             
80	                                A charming paid-for addition to New Horizons that doesn’t feel exploitative even as it comes off the back of one of the best free updates in recent gaming history.                            
80	                                There is nothing I like more in Animal Crossing than fidgeting around my house and changing the layout on a whim. That’s all you’re going to do in Happy Home Paradise, and for me, that’s more than enough to keep me logging in every single day.                            
80	                                The formula of the DLC is perfect for its playful potential.                             
80	                                Happy Home Paradise is a relaxing add-on to the base game.                            
80	                                Animal Crossing New Horizons: Happy Home Paradise allows players to get creative, adding new furniture and design choices at every turn.                            
80	                                Once players complete every milestone in their career, they can continue to update facilities, remodel homes, and offer new designs to visiting clients. This gives players a lot of content to discover and play through. When combined with the 2.0 update, the Happy Home Paradise DLC offers players a variety of new mechanics to unlock and use both at the resort and on their own island. Each new feature in Animal Crossing: New Horizons 2.0 and Happy Home Paradise adds to the players' overall experience by creating new customization options and different areas to explore.                            
80	                                Happy Home Paradise is proving to be a very honorable addition to Animal Crossing: New Horizons which is intended for none other than decoration enthusiasts. If the experience can be repetitive, it is best appreciated during quiet short sessions. And apart from a certain lack of ergonomics, the expansion benefits from long hours of additional activities, adorable and new inhabitants as well as very interesting elements transferable in the base game.                             
75	                                Happy Home Paradise is a delightful DLC package that allows you to express your creativity without putting any pressure on you.                            
75	                                Rather than a coat of paint, this DLC is more like an extra room added to the ground floor. Whether you want to build a couple houses or a whole map full of them, the Happy Home Paradise DLC has you covered.                            
70	                                Despite its clear downfalls, Happy Home Paradise is your first-class aerial ticket to design heaven. While the game does little to incentivise players, it ticks all the intended boxes of a near-sequel to Happy Home Designer. Perhaps the biggest advantage of the DLC is that it allows players to have their own vacation islands, so they can experience the story individually. On the other hand, the complete lack of personality from the characters means Animal Crossing fans may yearn for the hazy days of New Leaf. A classic case of paradise, lost.                            
70	                                Happy Home Paradise gives you the easiest job in the world. Creating holiday homes for various Animal Crossing characters is about as pressure-free as it gets when you're given a clear direction, a curated set of furniture to choose from, and the knowledge that the customer will love whatever it is that you do. There's no risk of a Changing Rooms disaster here. It's another avenue to express yourself in New Horizons, just don't expect much challenge, critique or need to think too far out of the box.                             
90	                                While not perfect, Supermassive Games hears players and House of Ashes is the best release in the Dark Pictures Anthology to date. The improved game mechanics, environment and story make it a creepy experience that is perfect for Halloween.                            
90	                                The Dark Pictures Anthology: House of Ashes is an impressive addition to the series that not only looks stunning on next gen, but also plays out in multiple player controlled scenarios, than can vary from triumphant, to downright heart breaking. It’s a dark journey through horror and blood, with only you (and maybe a friend in co-op) to determine who makes it out the other side.                            
90	                                The Dark Pictures Anthology: House of Ashes might not be very frightening, but it absolutely nails a tense atmosphere where every choice really does matter. With gorgeous visuals and a satisfying, well paced story, Supermassive has finally found their footing.                             
90	                                The Dark Pictures Anthology: House of Ashes is a fantastic feat in the adventure narrative genre. There's a focus on character drama to make the cast more dynamic and a group of flesh-eating demons to keep your heart racing. Choices have a considerable impact, but there's room to play again and again, with accessible options to fine-tune the experience and a new camera system to enhance exploration. Alone or with friends, no matter how you play, a nightmare awaits.                            
90	                                The Dark Pictures: House of Ashes is the best entry in the series yet, packed with gripping storytelling, compelling characters, and solid performances. Your choices feel impactful, and seeing your relationships grow or fall apart based on your decisions carries a lot of weight. With tons of collectibles, an improved camera, and solid pacing, House of Ashes will keep you glued to the screen until the credits roll.                            
85	                                Quotation forthcoming.                            
85	                                A tense, action-packed tale that feels completely different from what you've come to expect from The Dark Pictures Anthology so far.                            
81	                                House of Ashes marks a change of pace from previous episodes of the Dark Pictures Anthology, offering a horror story that also focuses heavily on action. The plot, which incorporates elements of films such as Aliens, Predator and The Descent, does not shine for originality, but is overall enjoyable and sufficiently articulated. There is still some occasional uncertainty in the interactions between characters, but overall the dialogues are good and the narrative crossroads are numerous and lead to endings that have significant differences between them. The new gameplay features do not change the gaming experience, but improve it slightly, while graphics/sound remains on good standards.                            
80	                                The third installment of The Dark Pictures Anthology brings a more action-packed story and a different kind of twist. If you liked the first two, you will probably enjoy this one at least as much. Just make sure to sharpen your reflexes, because this game is really unforgiving. Yet those that endure it will be left with an unforgettable horror experience.                            
80	                                House of Ashes is the best iteration in the franchise yet. The horror feels more mature and the jumpscares are not as prominent as before. The animations are not always great and next-gen features are yet to be used fully, but suspense and scares are guaranteed. In a dark room on a stormy night, you are ensured to have a sleepless night or two.                            
80	                                At the end of the day, if you already liked The Dark Pictures games, you should really enjoy House of Ashes. Its story is unique, complex, interesting, and suspenseful without relying on cheap scares. If you didn’t like Little Hope or Man of Medan, but are still open to enjoying the series, House of Ashes is worth giving a shot.                             
80	                                Its setting and characters offer a fresh perspective for the series, while Supermassive's penchant for creating tension through something as simple as a QTE is as masterful as ever. It might not be particularly fear-inducing, but its action set-pieces are fraught with peril for the fate of its characters, and the final act sticks the landing with a satisfying payoff. The series might still be stuck in the smothering shadow of Until Dawn, but House of Ashes is a step in the right direction.                            
80	                                House of Ashes is far from perfect, and the Dark Pictures system still shows room for improvement. But both mechanically and narratively this is its best outing yet – by far – and horror fans happy with an interactive narrative will find more to love here than ever before.                            
80	                                A good sequel with high replay value for this kind of games and with some minor technical advantages for users on PS5 and Xbox Series consoles. If you like the series, you need to play it. If not, House of Ashes won't change your mind about the series.                            
80	                                The Dark Pictures Anthology: House of Ashes is far and away the best Dark Pictures game so far. It blends intriguing characters, compelling drama, and a killer twist to offer up what can only be described as the most honed experience Supermassive has put out in this series so far. It's got a few minor issues here and there – namely relating to the diversity of its cast and how much each of them plays into the overall story – but it's a horror experience that no fan should miss even if they weren't fans of Man of Medan or Little Hope.                            
80	                                In flicking back through my notes on House of Ashes, I find that I have been more negative on it in this review than I remember feeling from my time playing it. It is a highly enjoyable experience and hard to put down. It might not be as spooky as I’d like from a horror game, and it might not play the way I think it should given the type of horror the developers were aiming for, but ultimately, holding the lives of a bunch of delinquent characters in my hands and deliberately letting them fall to their proverbial (or perhaps literal) deaths will never fail to be a (ghoulishly) good time.                             
80	                                And while the graphics are better than the games made for prior generations, I believe that Supermassive has to do some major upgrades that eliminate latency, improve the movement, and still reach an even better level of graphics realism. I’m looking forward to more entries in this series. If I think of The Dark Pictures Anthology by itself, I believe this series is getting better with time.                            
80	                                The Dark Pictures Anthology: House of Ashes is Supermassive's best horror game since Until Dawn made it famous.                            
80	                                An intriguing premise backed by refined gameplay and an immersive atmosphere makes House of Ashes the best entry in The Dark Pictures Anthology yet.                            
80	                                Supermassive has an incredible talent for creating gripping narratives of a horror persuasion, and despite some technical bumps in the sand, my retrospective opinion on House of Ashes still remains the same: It’s a bloody good creature feature.                            
80	                                House of Ashes is undoubtedly the best chapter in the Dark Pictures Anthology. The fascinating setting, a varied cast and the usual gameplay made up of tearing moral dilemmas and inevitable QTEs support an authentic descent into hell to discover an ancestral horror buried under the sands of the Iraqi desert.                            
80	                                House of Ashes is by far the best entry into The Dark Pictures Anthology yet. Supermassive Games has outdone itself in terms of visual design, storytelling and pacing, and the result is a game that's absolutely dripping with foreboding atmosphere. The story, playing out over six thrilling hours, keeps you on the edge of your seat from start to finish – and with so many possible outcomes, chances are you're going to want to jump straight back in. For horror fans, this is an absolute must-play.                            
80	                                The Dark Pictures Anthology: House of Ashes is yet another excellent offering from the masters of horror at Supermassive Games. While not every facet of its choose-your-own-adventure style narrative works, its compelling cast of characters and immense replayability will keep you coming back for more. I’ve played through the game twice in the past week, and I’m already dying to return to the underground with four friends to experience Movie Night mode. If that’s not a testament to the game’s lasting power, then I don’t know what is.                            
80	                                House of Ashes adds little to the Dark Pictures formula, and doesn't seem to progress the anthology's overarching plot. That said, it's still a great adventure with some jaw dropping visuals and action-packed set pieces. A solid addition to the franchise.                            
79	                                All in all, House of Ashes is a solid new entry in The Dark Pictures Anthology. While I ultimately found it to be a less engaging and frightening experience than its immediate predecessor, it’s still an enjoyable adventure title with some impressive animation work on display. And while I wasn’t in love with some of the changes, I respect that Supermassive Games is listening to fan feedback and attempting to innovate with each successive title. We’re due for at least one more of these games, so I’ll be very curious to see what the Curator has in store for us next time.                             
78	                                House of Ashes, the third installment of The Dark Pictures Anthology, is an entertaining game with high production values, yet it wastes its potential. It is an interactive movie that could be profound, but strives to be superficial in both its narrative and gameplay. It touches on sensitive historical issues, mainly the US invasion of Iraq. It is interesting to see how the war has shaped the personality of the protagonists, how it has affected their interpersonal relationships, and how they justify their role in the invasion. All these nuances, which could present a profound discourse on human logic in the context of war, are buried under a superficial story about a curse in ancient ruins. If someone is a fan of cinematic experiences, this is a game worth trying; It is a good game to pass the time, however it had the potential to be more memorable.                            
78	                                House of Ashes is a decent step forward for a series that also requires adjustments to hit the target. The third chapter of the Dark Pictures Anthology grows better narratively and in the writing of dialogues.                            
78	                                The Dark Pictures Anthology: House of Ashes is a unique tale from the crypt of Supermassive Games. The intriguing premise and methodical pacing help to build an overwhelming sense of trepidation, making you question what lies in the myriad of breathing shadows. Although the final third lacks the ambition and ingenuity of its early segments, it’s another great example and celebration of the horror genre.                            
75	                                House of Ashes does not distort the philosophy of Supermassive Games. While retaining the cinematic staging of The Dark Pictures saga, this third episode now offers a 360 ° camera and better integrated QTEs. Thanks to its controlled rhythm, its claustrophobic atmosphere and its interesting plot, it surpasses its predecessors despite its flaws (uneven writing, cartoonish characters, frozen shooting phases…). For anyone who enjoys interactive experiences of the genre, this latest iteration of the anthology is worthy of curiosity.                             
75	                                House of Ashes will not be remembered as a horror masterpiece in video games, but it is a good excuse to gather friends or family for a different night; already almost traditional. And thanks to that, the experience earns many points.                            
75	                                In the end, House of Ashes doesn’t offer a new unique tale that I found with Little Hope or Man of Medan. I did enjoy my time playing through another The Dark Pictures Anthology tale, but it hasn’t left an impact on me as a player as Little Hope did. Choices often felt inconsequential, and few and far between. Character development for all of the characters outside of Salim was underwhelming and disappointing, even though the backdrop of the Iraq War in 2003 was ripe for compelling character development.                            
75	                                Now in its third act, The Dark Pictures Anthology shows the first signs of a perhaps inevitable fatigue. Wisely trying to involve and amaze the player with unprecedented stylistic ideas, Supermassive Games chooses to adopt a more impactful pace, and thus creates another type of horror where violence takes precedence over restlessness. Between slight additions and repeated defects, House of Ashes is, without too many surprises, at the same qualitative level as its predecessors, with a small downward or upward decline based on the preferences of individual users, who may or may not like the cinematic sub-genre. staged by the studio. We do not yet fully know what the future of the series will hold for us, although the game - as always - provides us with some clues in the form of a premonition: what is certain is that the horror will change its aspect again.                             
75	                                House of Ashes never came close to terrifying or surprising me, but I still found it a respectable thriller that should make for an entertaining night alone or with up to four friends passing the controller. If you’ve enjoyed the Anthology up to this point, you’ll likely get a kick out of this too. But if you’ve been waiting for The Dark Pictures to reach the heights of Until Dawn, don’t get your hopes up for another year.                            
74	                                You can now say that The Dark Pictures Anthology offers a constant quality, where predictability is largely prevented by enough variety in setting and type of monsters. Unfortunately, the trick of five protagonists and player choices that determine the course of the story is starting to become somewhat transparent, so don't expect plot twists that will blow you off your seat.                             
73	                                Supermassive is back with an enjoyable adventure that we recommend playing with friends, although we also feel the core of the experience –the story– isn’t strong enough.                            
72	                                House of Ashes gives the impression of playing the same Supermassive game with a new story. The passage to next-gen systems looks irrelevant to a series that doesn't know how to evolve its formula. It has a better story than Little Hope, but presents the same issues already seen in the other two chapters.                            
70	                                House of Ashes is limited, but oh so entertaining. It's a bit sad that the focus on action overtakes some of the horror elements, but at the same time we appreciate that the story and the environments differ a lot from the anthology's previous titles.                            
70	                                House of Ashes is the most ambitious episode in Supermassive Games' The Dark Pictures Anthology yet. But having a well crafted story and great characters is not enough when many elements of the game -like the new, free camera or the many technical issues- are problematic thus keeping it from achieving greatness.                            
70	                                House of Ashes is a fun horror romp. There's nothing subtle to be found here and the game is all the better for it, with exciting set pieces and a fast-paced story. It has its issues, both technically and with not really having anything interesting to build into its Iraq War setting, but it's still a hoot to play.                            
70	                                House of Ashes, while not perfect, (or even scary truth be told) is a good installment in the series as it provides gorgeous graphics along with its interesting premise.                            
70	                                After the crummy Man of Medan and the better-but-not-quite-there Little Hope, The Dark Pictures Anthology has finally started hitting its stride with House of Ashes.                            
70	                                That basically sums up The Dark Pictures: Episode 3 - House of Ashes. It's a cheesy action-horror movie, except you can help characters survive (or die) with your button presses. It's not my favorite of the lot, but I was relatively engaged. It's an enjoyable enough B movie and feels like it would thrive the best as a multiplayer party game. If you've enjoyed the rest of the franchise so far, you'll enjoy House of Ashes because aside from some quality of life changes, it's largely in the same mold.                            
70	                                The formula works and is fun, even if it begs for a little more interaction. One of the best installments of the anthology so far.                            
70	                                House of Ashes can be, at times, a rewarding experience; however, the developers, in order to achieve a remarkable result in graphics, have neglected too much the pace and the interaction with the player.                            
65	                                The Dark Pictures Anthology: House of Ashes is the perfect game to curl up with this Halloween if you are looking for a scary game to play alone or with friends. However, there are too many stretches where you can put the controller down and forget it is a game at all. For anyone who enjoyed previous titles from Supermassive Games, House of Ashes is more of the same.                            
65	                                House of Ashes is not a bad game but it will not mark the spirits despite a neat universe and a beautiful atmosphere. Like the previous chapters the game is too short, especially since it takes time to get started, and it suffers from inequalities. The movements are too rigid, the camera angles suffocating and especially the choices seem illusory which removes salt to the experience. In the end we come out with the impression of not having had an impact on the story, even worse of not having really played... Pity!                            
65	                                With House of Ashes, Supermassive Games takes a more action oriented that some may regret. It is also less horrific, but still relies on effective dilemmas to guide its story. As for the graphics, they can be beautiful as well as a bit overdone and suffer from a sometimes strange facial animation. And although it still needs to be improved, we welcome the switch to free camera, as well as the 3 difficulty levels proposed for the QTEs. Still as cinematic as ever, the title offers us an adventure around a Sumerian legend with an undeniable replayability and which is perfectly suited to multiplayer games with friends.                            
65	                                The Dark Pictures: House of Ashes certainly changes things up for the anthology, with a cliché over the top story and a new tone that returning fans may not enjoy. But the strong cast and some interesting choices help prod the adventure along, even as its awkward new camera and dated visuals try to get in the way.                            
60	                                It does look nice on PS5. Keeping the squad alive is a tense affair and the creature design is a highlight in the face of so much else that turns out to be toothless. [Issue#8, p.86]                            
60	                                The best location in the series and an improved camera do not hide the sometimes blatant weaknesses of House of Ashes.                            
60	                                There's a lot to like in House of Ashes. It can look great (but also a bit ropey at points), the acting is largely excellent, and your actions (or lack of) can really impact the story. Yet, the game element is lacking, which in turn makes the gameplay sequences where you're in proper control end up lacking in scares. This is a fun time, especially if played in a group or online with a friend, but I was more afraid of button prompts than the monsters.                            
60	                                At the end of House Of Ashes’ seven or so hour run time, I felt similar to if I’d just watched a low-budget action film - something more akin to Dog Soldiers than the game’s intended influences. It was a good time but I don’t really feel like I need to play it again in order to get everything I’m going to get from it. The game ranks firmly above Man Of Medan, but below Little Hope, and I hope that the next chapter in the series leans back towards the horror aspects rather than the action.                            
60	                                A lackluster military versus monsters soap opera that just about redeems itself with an extravagant final third and unmatched co-op mechanics.                            
60	                                As much as I feel like this series is stuck in the shadow of Until Dawn for a large part of the audience, collectively, The Dark Pictures Anthology is becoming something memorable in its own right. I'll keep enjoying these games as long as I can, House of Ashes included.                            
58	                                I feel torn about House of Ashes. I’ve been overly negative here, but it isn’t by any means a bad game, it just didn’t gel with me in the way that Little Hope, for example, did.                             
50	                                House of Ashes is the third and the worst installment of The Dark Pictures, which makes us think that the whole anthology will end prematurely.                            
40	                                If only House of Ashes were possessed with something malevolent enough to actually scare us; sadly, it commits a litany of sins, none of them original.                            
95	                                Unsighted is this year’s best Metroidvania/Zelda-like game by a long shot. It’s creative, gripping, and accessible with a ton of stuff to do and see. There are a few small issues, like some awkward writing or too much menuing, but those are well worth it for such a fun, polished experience.                            
90	                                Unsighted is awesome. More people should know about it and play it, especially considering that the game goes out of its way to be accessible even to people who usually find Souls-like titles too hard, or people who dislike the timer mechanic but still want to experience the game, or even people looking for a harder ride. This is a good game and you should go play it. It’s not quite for everyone… but it’s as close as any title I’ve reviewed comes to being a must-play.                            
90	                                With couch co-op and the addition of Steam’s Remote Play Together, you can play with another person with just a single copy, provided you have a solid internet connection. Unsighted is an utterly amazing title for a debuting indie team that is well worth your money and attention.                            
90	                                For Brazilian developer Studio Pixel Punk, Unsighted is an accessible and content-rich debut with a compelling sci-fi drama at its core, and certainly in the argument for one of the best metroidvanias of the year.                            
88	                                Unsighted arrives like a bomb in the metroidvania genre that has been delighting fans over the years. Presented and released quietly, the work of Pixel Punk is an excellent reflection on our planet in a mix of situations that works splendidly and surprise for balance and the ability to mix everything.                            
88	                                UNSIGHTED deserves recognition and exposure not only for the crisp design, beautiful world, hypnotic tunes, and abundant secrets, but for the unique concepts it introduces to great effect, namely the NPC death timers. The stakes in games often lie in winning or losing a fight and having to expend more personal time on a fight that bruised our egos. Here, we have the added layer of humble automaton friends’ lives hanging by a thread. Even though I found several secrets throughout my initial trek, I am absolutely certain more can be uncovered; I just might take a rare plunge into New Game+.                            
80	                                Unsighted is a fun, quick little game, lasting me around ten hours on my first playthrough. Its combat and exploration are rewarding, the presentation is stylishly retro, and the narrative is good enough to round out the package. Some of the systems in place come across a little bit more tedious than they feel they should be, and the time-restriction mechanics don't do anything for me, but nitpicks aside, Unsighted is a solid pixel-art indie worth checking out.                            
80	                                Unsighted is hard enough to be a challenge, but just fair enough to hook you in for one more go. Well worth checking out.                            
70	                                Unsighted delivers engaging top-down action combat and a heartwarming narrative about connection, sacrifice, and love. The gameplay is fast and victory tastes sweet. Not everyone will enjoy the journey's burdens, and getting lost can frustrate you immensely, but the destination is worth the journey.                            
65	                                Had it been stripped away of some of its convoluted system, and instead focused on one or two features and story beats to go alongside its high level of polish and presentation, Unsighted would be a GOTY contender. But in trying desperately to be everything, Unsighted loses sight of the aspects that make it unique in an ever-expanding marketplace of retro-inspired Mentroidvanias. As a result, it’s an enjoyable, but ultimately forgettable experience.                            
90	                                Some jank does not stop Encased from being one of the most ambitious and greatest CRPGs in years.                            
85	                                If you like early Fallouts and other traditional 2D RPGs, if you think X-COM games from the 90s were awesome, if you enjoy reading sci-fi classics – this game was made for you. The story set in the alternative 1970s is not perfect and it’s obvious that the developers had to work with a tight budget, but Encased makes up for it with sheer fun. Actually, I think I haven’t enjoyed a game so much since Wasteland 3 was released. [11/2021, p.48]                            
83	                                A quality cRPG in the footsteps of classic Fallout that will satisfy fans of the genre. Some flaws do not allow it to reach the top scoring levels but in any case it is clearly a worthwhile purchase.                            
80	                                A rich, original-Fallout-inspired RPG with a brilliant story. You can play it in any way you want and it’s the good kind of gaming freedom. But the sound design could have been so much better.                            
80	                                Dark Crystal Games’ passion for this type of game shines through in every facet. They have made every attempt to make the game as accessible to a wide range of players as possible. The game feels tight in terms of performance and I encountered no bugs. How much one will enjoy the game really depends on how much one will put into it.                            
80	                                Encased: A Sci-Fi Post-Apocalyptic RPG is finally emerging from its nearly two year Early Access period and is all the better for its time spent in player-engaged development. Fans of Fallout 1 and 2 and Shadowrun are going to immediately fall in love with what Encased: A Sci-Fi Post-Apocalyptic RPG has to offer them, from its impressive character creation to vast world-building, from its ambient aesthetics to its divergent storytelling, and every nook and cranny worth exploring in between. You may be stuck underneath this Dome for the rest of your life, but rest assured you’ll be far too busy living your best post-apocalyptic life to care about anything outside of it anyway.                            
77	                                Encased: A Sci-Fi Post-Apocalyptic RPG is a worthy purchase for all fans of classic Fallout games, thanks to a well-crafted post-apocalyptic setting, great worldbuilding, reactive world, and solid overall gameplay. The clunky interface, basic combat, verbose writing, and overwhelming amount of status conditions to keep track of damage the experience a bit, however, making Encased a game that only the most die-hard RPG fans will enjoy right from the start.                            
77	                                It doesn't quite manage to reach Fallout's brilliance and quality, but Encased is still a fun experience, capable of providing lots of meaningful possibilities and an interesting new post-apocalyptic world to explore.                            
76	                                Multi-layered role-playing game for exploration and stealth enthusiastsand also everyone who doesn't care about exciting combat.                            
75	                                Encased is an old school RPG with lots of content and an exciting story. However, it is perhaps a little bit too faithful to the classics.                            
74	                                Encased is a very classic isometric RPG that harks back to early Fallout. There is great care taken in the game world and fans of the genre will get lost in it. It's a shame that the combat system isn't particularly layered.                            
70	                                Very responsive, fairly faithful to its inspirations, Encased knows how to offer a complete RPG, which intelligently responds to the decisions you make. Unfortunately, the title stumbles on its combat portion, rather failed and too anchored in the past, and is sometimes confused in the follow-up of the objectives to be accomplished. A pleasant experience, but not unforgettable, therefore, reserved for fans of old-school C-RPG.                             
70	                                I will say the amount of art, voice overs, and unique environments is really impressive. You’ll still have to do plenty of reading but they do a good job of making the world look, feel, and sound unique. Everything feels handmade and it almost makes me think if this developer team remade Fallout I just might make time for that trip back to the wasteland.                            
70	                                Encased can suck you into it for dozens of hours for exploration and complex, difficult battles with various tactics but also leave you frustrated with the way it approaches the story and characters.                            
70	                                If hard sci-fi sends you to sleep, you might want to give this a miss, because every now and then, the story be can a little dry. But for everyone else, if you’re prepared to give Encased your time and attention, and overlook what are mostly fixable flaws, you’ll discover an engaging, compelling and pleasingly deep RPG.                            
70	                                Encased is an interesting CRPG set in a dystopian alternative past that pays tribute to the original Fallout 1 & 2 for gameplay and core mechanics. Good storytelling and visuals. The combat lacks a bit of depth and strategy, but overall a good gaming experience.                            
65	                                Encased: a Sci-Fi, Post-Apocalyptic RPG seeks to recreate the best moments of the first Fallout games. Unfortunately, it also brought with it a lot of outdated mechanics and repetitive designs. Along with this, technical problems, bugs, and unreliable localization ruin the experience.                            
63	                                Encased has plenty of polish, but not enough substance beneath it. The game never goes anywhere with its 70’s setting, and, despite the “sci-fi” part of the name, doesn’t even try to consider the scientific implications of the premise.[Issue#255, p.60]                            
60	                                "A very decent clone of Fallout." That's at the same time the biggest compliment, as well as the strongest criticism for Encased: A Sci-Fi Post-Apocalyptic RPG. It is a labour of love that is almost as fun as the one it passionately pays homage to, and is thus easy to forgive its lack of fine-tuning. Unfortunately, it also lacks what made Interplay's gem the legend it is, which is, of course, the writing. You see, the key word in the phrase "a very decent clone of Fallout," is the word 'decent.' This otherwise entertaining piece of software is definitely that, but decent just won't do for most people.                            
53	                                The world of Encased is scant on exciting adventures, yet it’s overflowing with gibberish to the point that it breaks any suspension of disbelief.                            
95	                                Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous is a bold, dark, epic saga, featuring an astonishing replayability value. The developers have experimented with Kingmaker, and have gone all-in with Wrath of the Righteous, creating one of the best story-driven CRPGs of late.                            
90	                                Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous has the potential to be one of the most memorable RPGS of 2021 - not only for its scope, but also for its quality and accessibility. Fans of this forgotten genre have here a massive sequel that has learnt and grown from past mistakes, while newcomers have a fantastic game in which to take their first steps in the world of CRPGs.                            
90	                                Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous is exactly what I’ve been looking for in terms of a video game version of a traditional D&D campaign. I haven’t been able to play D&D with my group in over a year and a half, but Wrath of the Righteous scratches that itch, and then some. This is easy for me to say as a more casual tabletop RPG player. However, I’m confident in saying that Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous is rich and robust enough that even the most battle-hardened tabletop RPG veterans can have a blast while saving Golarion.                             
90	                                For those who miss the feeling of a long tabletop campaign or have been craving a new isometric RPG, Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous is the game for you. It's not perfect, but it has most of the best parts of playing a game with pen and paper while ironing out some of the fiddly and boring parts so you don't have to deal with them. Owlcat Games has taken what it learned from Kingmaker and improved upon it to give us something new and fun — no dice required.                            
89	                                Rich storyline, impactful choices, difficult fights and great adaptation of pen-and-paper mechanics make Wrath of the Righteous a true RPG gem. [Issue#255, p.34]                            
88	                                If you’ve been yearning for a good RPG to dig your teeth into and have fond memories of the classic isometric games from the late 1990’s then Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous is probably something you will enjoy.                            
87	                                Wrath of the Righteous is a true RPG epic, which, despite a silly quirk,surpasses its predecessor.                            
87	                                An excellent RPG with tons of content. A great story and complex mechanics promise long hours of fun, but a good amount of bugs could ruin the experience to some players.                            
85	                                Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous is a prime example of developers learning from the first game to improve upon the second. While there are still technical issues, it is a great game for Dungeons & Dragons and Pathfinder fans alike.                            
85	                                Although rather conventional in content and form, Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous is definitely the new role-playing game to put in the hands of all fans of the genre. By the richness of its gameplay, with a large number of builds, an alignment system for roleplay, crusade and kingdom management, as well as its dense content. Owlcat's new production is exciting in many ways, and even if it is not completely without flaws, it will keep you busy for a long time.                            
85	                                Featuing stellar depth and compelling storytelling, Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous is the next logical step for the franchise. It improves upon its predecessor in every feasible way, despite its intimidating exterior. This is an adventure that you won't want to miss.                            
85	                                Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous is an exemplar of the CRPG genre, allowing the player to go on a very specific and incredibly rich fantasy journey, with mechanics and systems to add depth, variety and replayability at every turn. While it is much more welcoming to casual players than Kingmaker, there are still a great number of things to comprehend, manage and optimize in the course of play and the game is not without some jank and bugs. The new Mythic Path element is a literal game changer, the story and characters are engaging and although still just a bit intimidating, Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous improves on its predecessor in significant ways. There are a lot of excellent ARPGs on the market, and Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous certainly deserves a place among them.                            
82	                                A swarm of bugs is the only serious flaw of Wrath of the Righteous. While the developers managed to avoid a Kingmaker-level catastrophe, please do save this game for the upcoming holidays, or maybe even take a vacation — it’s worth it.                            
82	                                An enormous, ambitious, and complex RPG, that will be adored by min maxers and Pathfinder Savants. Unfortunately it retains some of its predecessor's issues, and this keeps Owlcat's new project from being a bonafide masterpiece in the genre.                            
80	                                Wrath of the Righteous is a deep, engaging, faithful recreation of the tabletop campaign with only minor flaws. Its Crusade system is imperfect and the learning curve is more of a mountain, but the reward for getting through both is a long experience with incredible replay value. I know I will be replaying a few times soon, and I invite you to do the same.                            
80	                                Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous is what every CRPG should be. Great storytelling, complex and detailed combat system, very well written characters and an artistic compartment that does its job very well. A must play for the fans of the genre.                            
80	                                Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous is an enormous isometric RPG that builds on its predecessor with a lot of depth and a strong turn-based combat option.                            
80	                                Despite the negatives, Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous is overall an exceptional and colossal CRPG, a true spiritual successor to the original Baldur’s Gate and Icewind Dale titles. For those who love this type of game — the challenges, micromanagement, deep lore, and stat tracking in a fantasy RPG setting — Owlcat Games’ latest offering will more than satisfy. Gamers hoping for a less intense, less mentally demanding, more polished RPG experience would be better off looking elsewhere.                            
80	                                Wrath of the Righteous offers an epic campaign that'll make you feel important right from the beginning and that will keep throwing outrageous enemies and events at you. This second Pathfinder doesn't evolve much though, and still misses some mechanism that would set it apart. The tactical Heroes stuff doesn't do the job.                            
80	                                Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous is certainly a worthy successor to Pathfinder: Kingmaker. With its highly varied moral choices, a tremendous number of race and class options, as well as the Mythic Path feature, players will have a ton to dig into. That said, the addition of turn-based crusade battles where you lead armies across the land doesn’t quite land as well, feeling sluggish and lacking many of the tactical nuances of the main combat mode. In all, however, despite the experience not being the most polished, Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous is a deep, challenging and highly enjoyable title that is an easy recommend for fans of RPGs.                            
80	                                The way in which you cut your own destiny within Wrath of the Righteous might be as close to the creative freedom of a proper tabletop RPG campaign as I've gotten out of a video game adaptation of one.                            
80	                                A conservative yet meaningful evolution of the classic RPG.                            
80	                                Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous is an epic adventure with a lot of battles, and a new system for an epic warfare against demons. If you like Pathfinder, you'll love this new adventure.                            
80	                                Wrath of the Righteous feels like playing an epic tabletop campaign. Owlcat Games did a fantastic job of adapting the Wrath of the Righteous Pathfinder campaign into a video game. The more focused story, streamlined gameplay, and epic scope make it a better entry point to the series than Kingmaker. There's an excellent game buried under its many technical faults, but those going in need to be aware that they'll have to endure a lot of annoying bugs and glitches on their quest.                            
80	                                Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous is a faithful adaptation of the tabletop RPG, featuring an engaging story, well-written characters, and extremely deep gameplay mechanics. Although Owlcat Games' did their best to make the game feel welcoming to newcomers with plenty of in-game resources, tutorials, and difficulty customization options, the depth of the experience can be intimidating. Those who brave through the initial confusion, however, will find one of the best computer RPGs released in recent times.                            
76	                                A long game of choose-your-own-chosen-one with high highs to balance the lows.                            
75	                                With the Fifth Crusade, Owlcat Games has unsuccessfully attempted to create an expansive and immersive world. The overworld army combat and city building are merely copies of systems that are done better in other games, and it all ultimately ends up being a bunch of time-consuming rigamarole that destroys the pacing of the core RPG experience. Sometimes less is more.                            
70	                                Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous is not a big improvement over Kingmaker, but it is an improvement, nonetheless. Some of its elements are exceptional, like the overwhelming variety in classes, skills, and "paths," or the general epic aura it has, while some other parts sit somewhere between decent and good, like the story (which is a bit too stereotypical), the Crusade portion of the gameplay (which is a buggy chore), and the actual role-playing, which, while fine and all, won't be enough for those spoiled by other modern classics of the genre. Despite some its flaws, it is undoubtedly very entertaining, and highly recommended, as it will surely satisfy your hunger for a good RPG.                            
100	                                Shin Megami Tensei V wants you to become a God, and throws everything it’s got at you to test your mettle. At times rebellious and stubborn, Atlus’ artisanal approach to RPG craft makes up for any shortcomings. Those possessed of a dedication to weather its sand-blasted, ruined world will uncover a treasure that’ll lodge in their minds like a revelation. This is hardcore role-playing at its most efficient, dressed up in a bleak, nihilistic story and given life by a compendium of demons that make Pokemon look amateurish. God only knows how a follow-up could top this.                            
100	                                SMT V is perhaps a little too smart for its own good, and might alienate some people in the process, but it’s also refreshing to have developers create something that actually dares to have that level of confidence in their audience. This is a game that makes few concessions and compromises, but it is rewarding in kind and has a kind of elevated gravitas that marks it out as a rare and special thing indeed.                             
100	                                Minor graphical hiccups aside, Shin Megami Tensei V is an outstanding RPG, made all the more so by its countless improvements over its older siblings. It's tough but enthralling, and brimming with style. More importantly, perhaps, it has great ideas executed to something near perfection. It's been a long wait since Atlus first announced SMT V at the Switch reveal show, but it was absolutely worth it.                            
100	                                All in all, I’ve absolutely enjoyed my time spent with Shin Megami Tensei V. If you’re looking for a good, meaty RPG to sink your teeth into this holiday season, it definitely fits the bill. The small additions made to the Shin Megami formula work out really well here, and the game doesn’t feel hindered on Switch hardware. It’s nice to see the series leap away from a handheld platform and back to a mainline console release, and hopefully this will draw more attention to Shin Megami Tensei as a whole. So yeah, definitely consider checking this one out when it drops on November 12th, I don’t think you’ll be disappointed.                             
100	                                Shin Megami Tensei V is an incredible and memorable experience. It does some extraordinary things, both in terms of gameplay and its story.                            
95	                                Shin Megami Tensei V is not only the best entry in the series, but also one of the best JRPG of the recent years. A deep story with good mechanics and lots of classic and new demons await in this game. It is not for everyone, but any lover of the genre is in for a treat.                            
95	                                Shin Megami Tensei V on Nintendo Switch retains all the strategic combat elements that the Atlus RPG franchise is known for, but it radically revolutionizes its world design to create an adventure that is completely addicting and flawlessly complements the battle system. It’s a truly remarkable achievement, resulting in easily one of the best games of 2021 and one of the best games on Nintendo Switch in general.                            
95	                                Over the last few weeks, there hasn't been a single waking hour I haven't thought about Shin Megami Tensei V. The combat, music, and design are all amazing and the only area it falters is in the technical aspects. Despite that, this is one of the best JRPGs in years and everything I wanted from a new Shin Megami Tensei game.                            
95	                                Featuring a new approach to exploration and extremely solid gameplay, Shin Megami Tensei V masterfully balances innovation and tradition to offer an excellent JRPG experience.  While the technical issues can get in the way, the game's quality is so high that most will be willing to look past them, as Shin Megami Tensei V is one of the best entries in the series and one of the best JRPGs released in 2021.                            
94	                                Quotation forthcoming.                            
92	                                Shin Megami Tensei V manages to improve on a supposedly perfect combat system by introducing new options that offer a welcome extra level of complexity. The storyline is a little less convoluted than usual, and the graphics engine struggles at times, but the end result is a truly impossible-to-drop RPG and one of the most successful exponents of the genre on Switch.                            
92	                                Shin Megami Tensei V is a premiere JRPG that can’t be missed. Don’t let worries over difficulty (the game has four difficulty settings, one will work for you, I promise!), legacy (this is a whole new direction for the series), or performance (it can get a bit sluggish at times, but the developers have utilized a lot of tricks to make the game run smoothly most of the time) stop you from playing one of the best games of the generation.                            
90	                                It’s been a while since I’ve played a JRPG quite as captivating as Shin Megami Tensei V. Its dangerous world is a pleasure to explore, and recruiting a small army of demons is shockingly addictive. Some may be disappointed by the lack of story scenes, but I enjoyed the fact that it just lets you get on with developing your party without any fluff; the focus here is on the journey. If you’re a Shin Megami Tensei fan or into RPGs that favour gameplay over storytelling, consider this a must-have.                            
90	                                Instead of aggressively sanding off any and all edges in order to appeal to the broadest audience possible, the game takes the exact opposite approach. It not only wears those edges like gleaming badges of honor, but is fully intending to stab you in the throat with them. It wants to challenge you, to desperately shake you out of complacency. SMT V is not a game for everyone, far from it, but what it trades for accessibility it gains in depth and lasting satisfaction.                            
90	                                Shin Megami Tensei V has given me so much fun during my almost 60-hours playthrough that I wasn't able to put the console down. The game has a good story and addictive gameplay - an almost perfect return of this famous series.                            
90	                                Shin Megami Tensei V is one of the best RPGs of the year. A memorable installment, and a good introduction to the series. Without a doubt, spectacular.                            
90	                                Shin Megami Tensei V represents a bold new step forward for the venerable series. While I suspect some long-time fans may be put off at just how many changes are on the table, I think Atlus has done an impressive job of retaining the elements that made the previous games work while injecting ambitious new ideas that make for a truly fresh take on the genre. The complexity and difficulty may turn off some newcomers, but this latest entry gives players more tools than ever for overcoming the many challenges contained within. I wish the story had been equally enterprising, but it’s a small (and highly familiar) flaw on an otherwise fantastic game.                            
90	                                Each entry on the main series of SMT is significant on its own and this one is not different. A notable evolution in world building and general design that respects its own tradition and core values.                            
90	                                Shin Megami Tensei V is a severe JRPG, at times even a bit 'heavy, but capable of standing out thanks to its flawless integralism in building an extraordinary gameplay.                            
90	                                Shin Megami Tensei V is a traditional RPG with dense gameplay, a fantastic cast of demonic creatures, and some of the best visuals on Switch. It’s a stellar experience that holds steadfast to its old-school origins but gives the huge world and gameplay mechanics just enough smart changes to make every moment a blast. A sinister, magnificent, and deeply satisfying new contender for the best RPG on Switch.                            
90	                                Shin Megami Tensei V is pretty much the sequel that fans have been waiting for. There are a few potentially controversial decisions, such as the emphasis on an open-world area instead of the franchise classic dungeons, but they ended up working out in the end. The gameplay was fun from start to finish, and the 40-hour runtime seemed to fly by thanks to excellent pacing. If you liked Nocturne but wished it were more modern, SMT5 is the game you've been waiting for.                            
90	                                With its breathtaking battles, and the disorienting architecture of its Beyond, it enters the Olympus of the best titles for the Nintendo Switch.                             
90	                                Shin Megami Tensei V does not renovate the franchise but improves the formula and moves closer to a new generation of players with quality of life adjustments and modern features, while delivering one of the most impressive and unsettling world to date.                            
90	                                Putting aside slight gripes with performance, Shin Megami Tensei 5 is still largely excellent on Nintendo Switch. Returning fans, especially those with a love for SMT 3: Nocturne, will absolutely enjoy the fifth entry. New players and fans of JRPGs will equally find a lot to love with this entry as well. SMT 5 plays out like a true modernization for the Shin Megami Tensei franchise, overhauling and revamping the visual and gameplay design in a way that remains both traditional and progressive. Atlus is taking a big step forward with Shin Megami Tensei 5, and for the most part, nails all of the aspects that make it a stellar entry in the long-running JRPG franchise.                            
90	                                Shin Megami Tensei 5 is yet another gem for the Nintendo Switch that every JRPG fan needs to check out.                            
90	                                A staggering scope of ambition paired with a frankly absurd amount of mechanical depth make Shin Megami Tensei 5 a great game, and a must play for any and all fans of the genre.                            
90	                                I didn’t think ATLUS had it in them to make a game with the level of ambition packed into every inch of Shin Megami Tensei V.                            
90	                                Shin Megami Tensei V trascends divinity achieving a perfect balance between heaven and hell: it's and ode to the classics, to those JRPG's that weren't afraid of being complex and challenging, but it's also a modern game, adapted to current times and trends.                            
90	                                It's probably inevitable that Shin Megami Tensei V won't be exactly what everybody wanted from a new entry into the franchise. Although I had a few qualms with it overall, and there are definitely some growing pains with its direction in places, I came away mostly content with how Atlus handled this latest installment. While Shin Megami Tensei V's new direction may not suit everyone's expectations for the series, Atlus has returned to the franchise with an ambitious fifth entry.                            
90	                                Now that we’ve finally closed the book on the 2017 Switch presentation, I think Shin Megami Tensei V might be my favourite game to emerge from that show. That’s not a comparison I make lightly given the other games that appeared that night, but for my money and time it was worth the wait. Pokemon might be ending the year of RPGs on Switch, but SMT V is the best monster catcher for your buck yet.                            
90	                                Shin Megami Tensei V is a modern masterpiece. It successfully delivers on all the aspects that have made the series thus far so popular with fans—namely through its high difficulty, heavy narrative themes, and expansive team-building options—while polishing up and tightening the weaker aspects. Things like a more easily navigable map and more difficulty options to cater to players of all skill levels comfortably make this the most approachable entry in the series, and it feels like there’s more things to do in the world than ever before. If you are at all a fan of RPGs or have been looking for a good entry point into this oft overlooked series, we would strongly encourage you to pick this up as soon as you can. Shin Megami Tensei V was worth the wait, Atlus has successfully stuck the landing with this one.                            
90	                                Although it’s been a while since the last mainline game, Shin Megami Tensei V lives up to the hype.  This is a JRPG you won’t want to miss.                            
90	                                Shin Megami Tensei V is an excellent Switch exclusive worthy of its name, with the game feeling like the natural next step in the long-running series while introducing new elements that elevate it above even its contemporaries while not straying too far from its roots, offering fans a must-play experience and for everyone else, a JRPG worth jumping into.                            
90	                                Shin Megami Tensei V is an incredible achievement. While it comes off as less of a horror game than previous entries in the series, its sheer scale and eerie presentation more than make up for the lack of dedicated scares. In some ways, I feel that gaming technology has finally reached the point that it’s able to convey the tone and feel that Shin Megami Tensei has been trying to capture since the 80s. There's a lot packed into this game, especially if you play on a higher difficulty, which I definitely recommend doing. If you’re allergic to grinding, there is an optional Safety difficulty that will let you focus on the story instead, but you’ll still probably spend a lot of time exploring the expansive game world and getting lost between buildings.                            
90	                                The seemingly endless possibilities of Shin Megami Tensei V directly fueled my desire to play it from the moment I got my copy.                            
90	                                I’m in awe of its aesthetic, particularly the protagonist and his long, blue hair. I love the intense, nu-rock soundtrack that plays during a typical fight, and I could spend hours vibing to the jazzy score that accompanies you when walking through the school. The variety of demons is fantastic. The characters are unique yet reminiscent of ones who’ve come before. It’s a game I could play for hours, even with multiple deaths halting my progress at what always feels like the worst possible moment.                            
90	                                Shin Megami Tensei V is a masterfully made JRPG and fascinating work of art. While the characters could have used more fleshing out and the leveling curve is wildly uneven, it’s still incredibly fun with thrilling combat and a gripping plot.                            
90	                                It’s not a stretch to say that Shin Megami Tensei V has set a new standard for JRPGs. It’s amazing to see how far along this series has come since the initial inception of Megami Tensei, and the fa ct that ATLUS can continue to improve the series without compromising its core features. Shin Megami Tensei V has been a long time coming, but the wait has absolutely been worth it—and I’m more excited than ever to watch the SMT franchise continue to grow.                            
90	                                Even without strong narrative backing, Shin Megami Tensei V delivers a compelling experience for the entire 60+ hour journey. The game smartly provides the player with core features the series is known for, alongside excelling in its fantastic environments, combat mechanics, and immaculate soundtrack. Shin Megami Tensei V is a natural evolution of this series and a must-play RPG.                            
90	                                Shin Megami Tensei V is an excellent game that more than lives up to the expectations of its specific series. While its innovations grate against its more ancient elements, what emerges is still something that manages to capture attention for its hefty playtime.                            
90	                                Shin Megami Tensei V boasts extraordinary visuals, a familiar gameplay and an interesting narrative alongside AAA production values that, in the end, make for one of the best RPG of the whole year and, most likely, even the decade.                            
88	                                Shin Megami Tensei V is a great JRPG game that will make new players love the series while making the long-awaited SMT fans happy.                            
87	                                Shin Megami Tensei successfully builds over the third entry in the franchise, upping the ante with a great combat system and more freedom to explore. One of the best JRPGs in the last few years and a great exclusive for the Nintendo Switch.                            
87	                                SMTV gives fans of the series all they need and want, wrapped in an all new look with quality of life features which enhance the classic gameplay with fresh highlights such as exploration. Its Old School RPG-feeling mixed with some modern features creates an enjoyable role-playing game with some twists.                            
86	                                Shin Megami Tensei is one of the best RPGs of recent years. His fights exude that traditional aroma, but they have elements that make him unique. And its history, although confusing in its beginnings, when it clicks it no longer lets go. It has all the components to do wonders for fans of the genre.                            
85	                                If you're in for a challenge and got time on your hands, then Shin Megami Tensei V has a lot of content for you to enjoy. Certain parts might seem a little dragged out, but it's a fantastic RPG on the Nintendo Switch with in-depth gameplay systems that is equal parts punishing and rewarding.                             
85	                                Shin Megami Tensei 5 is one of the Switch’s best RPGs, which is saying something considering the strength of the genre on Nintendo’s hybrid system. While it rewards preparation and making the most of all of its mechanics, its difficulty may put off some players. Still, if you can persevere, you’ll be rewarded with an intense and unforgettable experience.                            
85	                                Shin Megami Tensei V is a solid evolution of the series with updated graphics and a thoroughly enjoyable overworld traversal system that rewards exploration although the battle system and monster recruiting remain a little too familiar.                            
85	                                Shin Megami Tensei 5 brings back the things that fans love about the series. Its biggest sin is that it doesn’t do much to innovate. Fans that were expecting to see a brand new vision for SMT will be confused because this is essentially the same demon collecting dungeon crawler it has always been. However, the quality of life improvements and the more expansive environments do add some new spice into the formula, and I had a blast fighting my heart out. It’s the archetypical JRPG, but that’s not a bad thing.                            
85	                                With Shin Megami Tensei 5, Atlus reaches new heights thanks to a surprising and particularly neat exploration aspect, while continuing to refine its formidable formula of capturing monsters and turn-based battles. The result is an ever-renewed gameplay pleasure, despite obvious technical weaknesses and a main plot too disjointed to fully convince. Finally, it is a monster of balancing, combining an unprecedented accessibility for the series with a high but far from insurmountable challenge: a game that should suck your soul for dozens of hours if you're up to the challenge.                            
85	                                Shin Megami Tensei V has a deep and satisfying combat system making every fight a challenge, as well as an engaging story and great visuals.                            
83	                                Shin Megami Tensei V makes smart improvements to its already strong core, creating an entertaining and rewarding journey.                            
80	                                Shin Megami Tensei V is sure to bring a large swath of fresh fans to the series with its beautiful graphics and complex turn-based strategy mechanics. It presents a challenge even on the easiest setting, and the demon recruitment process has been made all the better with livelier, more varied dialogue. Shin Megami Tensei V is only held back by some lacklustre storytelling in the first half, and the unfortunate performance on the Nintendo Switch, which was the wrong console to handle Shin Megami Tensei V’s powerful graphics.                            
80	                                If you have enough patience to survive this apocalypse, you'll find a deep story and very challenging gameplay based heavily on strategy. Fans of the series won't find much innovation, but they also won't be disappointed.                            
80	                                Ignoring some unpleasant technical hiccups like unstable framerate and poor asset streaming, and also a rather basic storyline, Shin Megami Tensei V is a big gift for the fans, and a great opportunity to jump into the series for new players.                            
80	                                There are a lot of great qualities of Shin Megami Tensei V that make it one of the best RPGs on the Switch by far. Its intricate battle system, fun demon fusion mechanics, and enhanced presentation will lure fans and newcomers alike but its pacing, difficulty, and lack of a gripping story may make you put down the game for a bit before picking it back up. It’s a game that needs to be savored slowly to fully taste its potential. Otherwise it may leave you with a bad taste in your mouth.                            
80	                                Presenting players with a beefy, challenging, and ultimately rewarding experience, Shin Megami Tensei V is a game that pulls newcomers into a polarizing experience. It is common to feel motivated to play the game for multiple hours, only to have that motivation knocked out once the current party lineup can’t stand against the next boss fight. However, it is also common to return to the game after a break and feel a strong sense of achievement after beating a particularly difficult foe. It’s an excellent entry point for those unfamiliar with SMT, should provide great joy for returning players, and should not be missed.                            
80	                                Shin Megami Tensei V is the best Shin Megami Tensei game thus far, without a doubt. It’s incredibly stylish and delivers an intriguing plot filled with the philosophical and metaphysical concepts that fans have come to expect. Its battle system is every bit as engaging as it’s contemporaries, and the fusion system remains as one of the best in the genre. And while it’s got some strong art direction, technical issues and ho-hum dungeon design keep Shin Megami Tensei V from being as great as it could be.                            
80	                                Shin Megami Tensei V is the Japanese RPG equivalent of mid-century modern design, as the classic style and attitude of the series gets enhanced by—but never replaced with—simpler and sleeker refinements and modernizations. In a moment when Atlus could have given Persona’s sibling series a more market-friendly makeover, the company has instead given us a game that’s as weird, punishing, and mysterious as any previous SMT release that came before. As a longtime fan who wasn’t sure if the team at Atlus still had games like this in them, Shin Megami Tensei V is shockingly satisfying—well, as long as you don’t ask too much of its characters or story.                            
80	                                Deep, multi-faceted gameplay anchors a story that spans modern Tokyo and the realms of gods, demons, and angels beyond. It's not for everyone, but hardcore JRPG fans will find a lot to love in Shin Megami Tensei V. It's a worthy entry in the long-running series.                            
80	                                Shin Megami Tensei 5 is a punishing delight. It revels in its classic approach to combat and exploration, brought to life with a battered and broken vision of our world as it teeters on the edge of extinction. JRPGs of the modern era are often content to hold our hands and guide us through each new journey, but Atlus decides to punch us in the gut, steal our wallet, and sprint away as we try desperately to catch up. As I’ve said time and time again, this isn’t a game for everyone, but those who gel with its specific brand of masochism will find something very special indeed.                             
80	                                For those who will have the courage to rub shoulders with it, they will find a generous title in its content and its mechanics which will have enough to occupy them for a good fifty hours of play.                             
80	                                With extensive and satisfying party customization, excellent combat, and challenging enemies, Shin Megami Tensei V never left me feeling bored or burned out across its epic length. Exploration and platforming sections lend some much-needed variety when you're fighting so many similar battles in a row. I just couldn't shake the feeling that this was Persona without the heart – without the unforgettable companion characters, the potent personal story, the incredible soundtrack, and the jaw-dropping twists and turns. Still, if you're looking for a meaty, demanding, endlessly deep, and overall outstanding JRPG to sink your teeth into, Shin Megami Tensei V has heaping portions of it.                            
80	                                At the end of the day, I'm not so sure that Shin Megami Tensei V really pushes the envelope forward for the series. It doesn't have the emotional brevity of the excellent Nocturne, nor does it present the same kind of moral quandaries that IV did. It certainly looks better and plays incredibly well, and from a gameplay perspective, this would easily be the most accessible entry of the bunch. It won't disappoint series fans, especially those who have been waiting for a series comeback for years, but it might be time for Atlus to think about where the series is headed next.                            
80	                                Shin Megami Tensei V seems like a “best-of” of the previous chapters. An amusing action-RPG hybrid with great emphasis on exploration, thanks to larger scale levels, and the funny “demon negotiations” feature that once again refreshes an established combat system.                            
80	                                Shin Megami Tensei V is a game that demands a lot of the player--its slow pace and punishing difficulty will more than likely turn some folks off. But those who stick with it will find an incredibly rewarding experience that only gets better the further in you get. SMTV truly makes you feel like the weight of this crumbling, conflict-torn world of mythological nightmares rests firmly on your shoulders--but it's a burden you'll be glad you chose to bear.                            
80	                                Shin Megami Tensei V is one of the best RPGs of 2021. It has an immensely-enjoyable combat system, some of the best and most varied battle music we’ve heard in a long time, and all the demonic creatures we’ve come to love from the series.                            
80	                                Shin Megami Tensei V does not suffer fools gladly. You will be punished brutally for attempting a battle that’s out of your league. But there’s so much to do in its expansive wasteland that working your way up to the challenge never feels like a grind.                            
80	                                The Shin Megami Tensei games have often been some of the most mechanically inventive and unique, and that remains the case with SMT5. Combat is challenging and dynamic, and the party-building options are limitless. My only issues with the game boiled down to JRPG tropes that likely won’t bother hardcore fans. It’s not only an excellent JRPG, but a wonderful new entry in one of the genre’s most influential games.                            
70	                                Shin Megami Tensei V is an overall decent game that retains all the familiar characteristics of the series (i.e. high challenge, great demons to fuse with and grinding). However, this new entry is a missed opportunity that lacks impact due to its performance issues and the repeatable areas of exploration.                              
70	                                The battle system is excellent but the Shin Megami Tensei series once again misses a golden opportunity to reincarnate itself, with its sparse plot and sky high difficulty.                            
70	                                It's not winning any awards for graphics, but Shin Megami Tensei V is a well-designed JRPG that has just a little too much combat. Even with such an interesting story and themes to explore, it instead focuses on grinding and fighting the same enemies over and over.                            
70	                                While Shin Megami Tensei 5 is rough around the edges, fans of the series will be satisfied. However, newcomers to the series and those not impressed by the previous entries best approach with caution.                            
60	                                There are excellent RPG ideas powering the game, but they’re left stranded in search of a worthwhile role to play.                            
60	                                Shin Megami Tensei 5’s combat is great, punishing and rewarding in equal measure without ever tipping the scales too far in one direction. Mixing and matching your deck of demons makes for great fun as well, and spurs you to look to all corners of the ruined world for allies of all shapes and sizes. It’s everything outside of the battling and grungy soundtrack where Shin Megami Tensei 5 badly misses the mark, with one-note characters that you’re never given the chance to better know, and a paper-thin plot that feels dragged out over dozens of hours. Shin Megami Tensei 5 is a good RPG battler, but it’s not good at much else.                            
85	                                Demon Slayer -Kimetsu no Yaiba- The Hinokami Chronicles is an experience that never overstays its welcome. While the map may be simplistic and outdated, the combat, visuals, voice acting, and story more than make up for anything the game lacks. New and old fans will find something to enjoy here, while the versus mode will keep players engaged long after the credits roll.                            
80	                                Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba – The Hinokami Chronicles is a great anime-based fighting game that’s only going to get better. Its story mode is a lot of fun to play through, thanks to the quality of the source material and CyberConnects2’s refined battle system that’s easy to pick up yet rewarding to master. Factor in the beautiful visuals and a decent amount of side content to engage in, and you have one of the best videogame adaptations of an anime we’ve ever had the pleasure of playing. If you’re a fan of the franchise, consider this a must-have. And even if you’re not, you might want to give it a go.                            
80	                                For fans of the source material or just arena fighters in general, Demon Slayer’s incredible combat and substantial story mode make this a must-play. Sure, the exploration sections may disrupt the pacing somewhat, and the online functionality could use some patching, but these issues don’t detract too much from the stellar foundation which CyberConnect2 has put in place.                            
80	                                Demon Slayer: The Hinokami Chronicles is a title made for fans full of fan service. The simple, but fun combat makes it one of the best anime games of recent years, but it still has a couple of problems.                             
80	                                While Demon Slayer -Kimetsu no Yaiba- The Hinokami Chronicles isn't the game to get me into the genre, I can't deny that it runs well and is mostly fun to play. Fans of the Demon Slayer anime - or fighting games in general - will be happy with this pickup.                            
80	                                Overall, The Hinokami Chronicles is an enjoyable arena fighter with a really intriguing story. There are moments where the game feels a bit too slow or uninteresting during the exploration moments, but the combat makes up for it. Fans of Demon Slayer will love plaything through The Hinokami Chronicles, and even newcomers to the series will enjoy this well-done fighting game.                            
80	                                The game offers exactly what it promises by presenting a high level of graphical fidelity, beautiful effects, a solid combat system, and a story mode that replicates some of the series’ best moments perfectly. The title also sets the foundations of what can become another successful series. With that said, Demon Slayer -Kimetsu no Yaiba- The Hinokami Chronicles is a title sure to hit the spot for both the fans of the acclaimed series and those of Arena Fighters in general.                            
80	                                This is going to sound like a backhanded compliment, but it's not intended as such: Demon Slayer -Kimetsu no Yaiba- The Hinokami Chronicles could have been so much worse. An anime that has become this celebrated was always going to deserve more than a copy/paste paint-by-numbers arena brawler, and the team at CyberConnect2 have done well with what I'm sure were significant limitations. There's respect there, and an understanding that Demon Slayer is more than a mindless series of fights, even if the gameplay system creaks with age and having been used for far too many other anime tie-ins. Mind you, if nothing else, being able to tear demons a new one with Nezuko has been something I've been looking forward to from day one with this anime, and if nothing else, CyberConnect2 delivered that.                            
80	                                Demon Slayer: The Hinokami Chronicles is a perfect way to relive the Kamado siblings' adventure, despite knowing what's around every corner. And for new fans, it is a great chance to experience the series from the get-go. While its VS mode may not be for everyone, the main story itself is enough to feed anyone's appetite, and its gorgeous visuals make it a feast for the eyes.                             
75	                                Demon Slayer: The Hinokami Chronicles is basically a game for the fans. Do you want to pick your favorite character and beat up your other characters? Or do you want to see scenes from the original story re-created in beautiful 3D? However, that is about all it offers. It's beautiful, plays well, accurately captures the source material, and that is the beginning and end. If you're curious about the uber-popular franchise, it's probably best to watch the anime or read the manga before diving in.                            
75	                                Demon Slayer: The Hinokami Chronicles is a loving recreation of the first leg of Tanjiro and Nezuko's journey. It might not push the envelope in any meaningful way, but I can guarantee that this will satiate Demon Slayer fans and maybe even provide some entertainment for newcomers. It delivers on exactly what's promised, and I think that is what most people will want out of The Hinokami Chronicles.                            
75	                                Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba – The Hinokami Chronicles features some incredible storytelling moments, but that’s mostly because it’s an exact retelling of the excellent source material. On top of this, you get to experience some of the most significant fights from the series firsthand. However, this comes at the cost of lengthy cutscenes and a game made for fans of anime and not necessarily fans of fighting games.                            
70	                                When the quality over quantity recipe goes too far, you get The Hinokami Chronicles. A visually stunning game based on a renowned anime, that painfully yearns for more content. It is full of forced activities that are there only to prolong the experience. Yet, the sides of it that shine are absolutely stunning. Not to mention that if you are a fan of the series, it will probably blow your mind.                            
70	                                Demon Slayer is true to its source material, closely following the initial story arc and Mugen Train. The single-player story is short and never really taxes the player.  The areas in between fights aren't inviting to explore as movement is slow and tasks obligatory. The roster of characters for online fights is small and partly locked behind the single-player storyline. In multiplayer, the fighting system blossoms, but it would have been great if the range of abilities was better used throughout the game.                            
70	                                A rather familiar anime fighting game that even though it does not excel in any way, it truly shows CyberConnect2's expertise on the genre.                            
70	                                Demon Slayer: The Hinokami Chronicles is a fan service game, and it doesn't hide it. If you are a fan of the first hour then you will have no problem to dive into this adventure which mixes combat and narrative phases, all in the enchanting universe of the anime. For the others, the experience will lose a lot of flavor. The story mode is not always well-paced and the Versus mode is clearly not enough on its own. In the end, the game is mainly for fans of Koyoharu Gotōge's work.                            
70	                                I walked into Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba - The Hinokami Chronicles without much knowledge on the source material, but the game's approach to its story had some highs and lows. On the one hand, much of the gameplay felt thoroughly average and there wasn't a lot that made me want to keep coming back. However, the presentation did, at the very least, make me interested in the anime. There were a lot of cinematics, maybe too many, but if their purpose was to draw interest to the anime, it did that job well. Not having every fighter out of the box is going to be really frustrating for some players, but if nothing else, experiencing the Demon Slayer story is a pretty fun ride.                            
70	                                The exploration sections are somewhat dull, the fighters are interchangeable, and the story is told in a separate menu, but the parts that need to work, do. Combat is crazy, fast, and deeply satisfying. Whether this is your first 3D arena fighter or your fifteenth, The Hinokami Chronicles are a lot of fun.                            
70	                                There’s a lot to like about Demon Slayer: The Hinokami Chronicles even if it isn’t exactly perfect. It’s a strong first step. The Adventure Mode’s execution and ideas are sound, even if it can feel a bit simple in practice. The Versus mode works well, with characters who feel distinct and have personalities come through. A few more fighters would be appreciated. It certainly looks good. And given a promise of free updates, it seems to have room to grow. In short, it’s enjoyable even if it isn’t perfect yet. And if what is here is the prelude to additional installments, a la the Naruto Ultimate Ninja series, I think it could hint at a bright future for Demon Slayer games.                            
70	                                The Hinokami Chronicles is an enjoyable adaptation of the Demon Slayer anime, but it never tries to be anything greater. The combat is fun, fast-paced, and lets the player wield the explosive moves of the Demon Slayer Corps in a visually exciting way, but the story mode that makes up the bulk of the single-player content is stretched too thin. Fans of the anime should enjoy The Hinokami Chronicles, but it won't have much appeal to those who aren't already familiar with the series.                            
70	                                Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba – The Hinokami Chronicles is a fighter that balances depth and accessibility well, but it’s hamstrung by an inconsistent story mode and a slim roster.                            
65	                                A middling exploration game with subpar fighting mechanics, it’ll be harder to enjoy Demon Slayer: The Hinokami Chronicles if you’re not already a fan.                             
65	                                Demon Slayer – Kimetsu no Yaiba – The Hinokami Chronicles is a solid first attempt at bringing this anime to a game format for current generation consoles. What SEGA and CyberConnect2 need to figure out is how to balance bringing the story into the next one while opening the world and trusting the player a bit more. I want to play and explore the anime, I don’t want to just watch it through my PlayStation 5. I have VUDU and HBO Max for the latter.                            
65	                                The confrontations underlined by visual effects of any beauty do honor to the sequences passed to the posterity of the animated series. Yet the lack of creativity in anything related to directing turns a supposedly epic and touching story mode into a simple succession of fights interspersed with phases of exploration of no real interest. As for multiplayer, Versus mode is content to show presence. Ultimately, the title of CyberConnect2 is to advise fans, and only fans of the work of Koyoharu Gotōge.                             
65	                                Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba – The Hinokami Chronicles is another decent brawler adaptation that sort of asks you to already have a bit of background on the source material to truly enjoy it. In that sense, it joins a very crowded space of many other anime games before it, and many of you out there know where you stand on these.                            
60	                                In short, this game feels very much like a stepping stone on the way to a better Demon Slayer game in the future — one with a wider variety of playable characters, more new combat features, and a longer storyline that can afford to cut out filler moments that pad the experience.                            
60	                                The game does offer fans plenty of quotes, profile pictures, and other knick-knacks to collect throughout its playtime, along with a number of play modes such as Versus and Training Modes to help sharpen your skills, but it feels as if something is missing from the experience that could elevate the first video game outing for Demon Slayer from good to great. If you're a fan of the series, or just want to see some eye-popping visuals with some fast and frantic gameplay, definitely check this one out, especially if you can overlook some of the game's faults along the way.                            
60	                                Demon Slayer: The Hinokami Chronicles is carried by its fantastic presentation, which expertly captures the look and feel of the anime. Bombastic boss fights and some stunning cutscenes are enough to sell the otherwise short-lived story mode, but outside of that, this is a rather barebones package. Battles can be flashy and fun, but the combat system doesn't have the necessary depth to hook anyone who isn't a Demon Slayer super fan. If this is just the first step in a new series from CyberConnect2, then it's a solid debut that'll no doubt form the basis for a much meatier sequel.                            
50	                                Demon Slayer: The Hikonami Chronicles is a bit lacking where it had everything to succeed: with a faithful representation of the characters of the anime, it does not go further, with an empty environment, dated textures and a technique that smacks of old, even on next-gen consoles, not to mention a cruel and glaring lack of variety in the action. But he has for him a model more than faithful to the anime and a combat system as simple as it is effective, which will appeal to the greatest number, despite a weak roster and great confusion in the action when several people are fighting at the same time. A game of average quality after all, for fans and for those who want to easily take their eyes off between combos.                             
65	                                The beauty of Away: The Survival Series isn't the gameplay but the journey itself. While it has it's problems with bugs, the environment itself is lovely and the narration and musical score at least give the short expedition a quiet elegance.                            
65	                                Away: The Survival Series sounds great on paper, as its nature documentary format gives it a charming quality you wouldn’t expect to work. And yet it does, to some extent. At the same time, its execution could still use a lot of work, leading to an adventure that tries to impress, but misses the mark due to some technical shortcomings that mar the experience. Its soundtrack, narration, and surprisingly detailed world make it worth checking out, but you probably won’t stick around for the next episode if things stay the way they are.                            
60	                                AWAY is a beautiful and educational adventure like no other, but major gameplay mechanics are poorly executed and take away from it being a standout title in the survival genre.                            
55	                                While AWAY: The Survival Series nails its nature doc narration conceit, it doesn’t have anything particularly enlightening to say. The game does sometimes succeed as a straightforward cinematic adventure, but rough controls and a general lack of polish derail the rollercoaster far too often. Playing AWAY can be compelling at times, particularly if you’re an animal lover, but you might find queueing up a few episodes of Planet Earth more fulfilling.                             
50	                                There are a lot of problems with AWAY: The Survival Series from the controls to the plot and the good graphics can't save the game.                            
40	                                I wish I had more positive points to speak about, but AWAY: The Survival Series just isn’t that fun to play, and being a video game this is one of the most important aspects for the developers to nail. The experience feels unnaturally empty and shallow, and whilst the good intentions are there, the execution makes it a hard title to recommend spending money on, at least in its current state which feels like an early access title, despite it being a proper release. If this title piques your interest, I would suggest waiting to see what the developers end up fixing and tweaking as they have promised to fix multiple issues and provide constant updates to offer a more polished title.                            
30	                                Buggy, broken, and boring, Away: The Survival Series is awful all around.                            
92	                                Sherlock Holmes Chapter One is a masterpiece of a detective game as it manages to deliver a thoroughly enjoyable open-world adventure with an interesting cast, stunning environmental visuals, and highly immersive and engaging sleuthing gameplay. The fact that I was having such an awesome time made dealing with the odd progression issue worth it as I loved taking in all of the sights and stories.                            
91	                                This version of Sherlock feels human, his methods of deduction are satisfying, and his cases are certainly intriguing enough to make aspiring detectives want to solve them all.                            
85	                                Sherlock Holmes: Chapter One is an exemplary experience for anyone wanting to enjoy time with our eccentric investigator. The story behind Violet Holmes' demise will pull at your heartstrings, and the cases you’ll decipher on the way there just make you appreciate Chapter One all the more. Yeah, there are some technical issues, and you’re most likely going to get stuck at least once, but unraveling the best laid plans of the most conniving criminals is a delight to accomplish.                            
80	                                Sherlock Holmes: Chapter One is a memorable game, maybe the best produced so far by Frogwares. It is not a classical adventure game, rather an open world Victorian tour de force in the early days of the most famous detective. As such it is not easy, mainly because the developers decided to let players figure out how a detective’s mind works. You must have patience and pay attention in order to figure out the Holmes family secret. But it is a rewarding journey, one that will make you feel invested in it. It might not be a perfect game, nor a AAA title, but it is fun and well crafted.                            
80	                                Unashamedly developed for fans of the series, Sherlock Holmes: Chapter One is a unique and deftly crafted take on a well-trodden character. Retaining its detail oriented, mystery solving core while moving to an open world design with a heavier inclusion of combat, this game retains the charm of its predecessors while pushing the series in an exciting new direction. It’s not perfect, but an excellent story and a plethora of ‘eureka’ moments make up for many of its flaws. If you loved Crimes & Punishments and The Devil’s Daughter, you’ll love this.                            
80	                                Sherlock Holmes: Chapter One is a big story-driven game with familiar characters, captivating cases to solve, and a big open island to explore. All the fantastical stuff aside, the team at Frogwares treats Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's work with utmost respect, and for that we are grateful.                            
80	                                Quotation forthcoming.                            
80	                                There are a few rough edges to Sherlock Holmes: Chapter One; the odd duff texture here and there, and lip syncing that never quite looks right. But none of that ever gets in the way of just how engaging a game this is to play. Stepping into the shoes of the young Sherlock Holmes is a real treat, and Frogwares continues to excel at doing what it does best: delivering an immersive experience that really makes the player feel like they’re actually a detective. This is by far the developer’s best yet.                            
80	                                Sherlock Holmes: Chapter One is Holmes but not as you know him, with a fantastic and unique story, plenty of crimes to solve, and a sprawling tropical island to explore.                             
80	                                Sherlock Holmes Chapter One puts the detective into an open world setting whilst giving him plenty of murders and side cases to investigate. There is the odd bit of action here and there but those who like to explore, examine and deduce will get the most out of this adventure.                            
80	                                Sherlock Holmes Chapter One is one of Frogwares’ best games to date.                            
80	                                The entire investigation was worth it and this is an origin worth exploring for any fan of mysteries or the great Sherlock Holmes.                            
78	                                The idea of Sherlock Holmes essentially investigating his own origins is an intriguing conceit, though that's really only a small element of Sherlock Holmes Chapter One. The invented island of Cordona is a great backdrop for commentary on the late Victorian British Empire in all its excessive and tone-deaf glory, though again, those considerations are secondary. Sherlock Holmes Chapter One is, at heart, a collection of large and small mysteries to be solved, the chance to inhabit the mind of a legendary polymath and play detective with a wide and deep arsenal of tools and toys. Although the series is still bogged down by its fiddly mechanics and the pace can move too slowly for us fidgety gamers, Sherlock Holmes Chapter One is far more ambitious in scope than its series predecessors and may represent a new, high bar for the franchise.                            
75	                                Sherlock Holmes: Chapter One is a pleasant tale of origins and investigation, which continues the extremely intimate and introspective approach of Frogwares towards the character created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. The game often stumbles upon the narrative errors of its predecessor, not delving sufficiently into some crucial ideas in the epilogue of the adventure. The meticulous management of clues, deductions and exploration linked to the cases to be solved makes the work a satisfying product for fans of the famous English investigator, as long as you turn a blind eye to a graphic sector that at times is somewhat obsolete.                            
75	                                For its ambitious prequel, Frogwares relied on an open world that enjoys a rather generous scope for a wide range of surveys. These also give the game a very solid lifespan. On the other hand, the proposal proves difficult to measure up on a technical level, with slowdowns, rigid animations and clipping in support. More engaging in its second part, Sherlock Holmes: Chapter One offers progressive dynamism and a commendable conclusion. The heart of the adventure lies in its clues to be connected and the accusations to be made, which follow a pattern of investigation which, however, runs out of steam too quickly.                            
73	                                Way better than Devil's Daughter, Sherlock Holmes: Chapter One has a captivating focus on Sherlock himself, but the open world feels there just for the sake of it.                            
70	                                Quotation forthcoming.                            
70	                                Despite these issues, it's difficult not to get sucked into Chapter One's web of intrigue. The central mystery is uneventful until its final moments, but the cases surrounding it are consistently excellent, and the role you play in solving them is incredibly gratifying. The open world is more of a backdrop than anything else, but it expands the game with dozens of side cases that are just as alluring as those found in the main story. Sherlock Holmes: Chapter One may stumble at times, but it scratches that investigative itch like few games even attempt to.                            
70	                                Despite a few missteps in terms of the combat, if you’re a fan of detective games then Sherlock Holmes Chapter One is a pretty easy one to recommend. Getting to do things like interviewing witnesses or performing chemical analysis on suspicious evidence is an absolute blast. The island of Cordona is chock full of cases for you to investigate and while there are a few technical issues with the open world setting it’s easy enough to forgive when sleuthing around is this much fun.                            
70	                                Sherlock Holmes Chapter One refines the formula of The Sinking City, offering a more investigative and varied game, which will probably appeal to hardcore fans of Frogwares' works. However, the main plot is a bit weak and rushed, although the total content is supported by various pleasant side events.                            
70	                                If you can get through the relatively humdrum, lifeless and unneeded open world of Sherlock Holmes: Chapter One you'll uncover a whip smart detective adventure that is up there with the series best. It's just a shame that a smattering of technical issues and poorly executed combat sections detract from what should have been the Pride of Baker Street's triumphant return to PlayStation.                            
70	                                Sherlock Holmes Chapter One is a flawed but nevertheless fascinating look at the angsty years of the great detective.                            
70	                                A fresh and emotional take on the Sherlock Holmes property creates the best narrative in the series yet, but it’s let down by some ambitious design choices.                            
60	                                Technical issues and an excessively padded out plot makes Frogwares' open-world rendition of its Sherlock Holmes games a disappointing experience.                            
60	                                A lot of the issues with Sherlock Holmes Chapter One can be resolved with updates. The performances issues can be ironed out, John's obnoxious behavior can be toned down, and an improved hint system could remove the frustration of being lost during a case. With a few tweaks, Sherlock Holmes Chapter One could be an interesting open-world twist on the detective genre. As it stands, the game at launch still needs work before Sherlock Holmes can fully embrace his role as the greatest detective of all time.                            
60	                                Sherlock Holmes Chapter One should, on paper, be the best game out of Frogwares yet. It brings back all those satisfying detective features of the past and couples them with new mechanics and interactions. However, many of them are either surplus or frustrating enough to where they sometimes detract from the overall experience. And with a lifeless open world that doesn't run particularly well at even the best of times, it's not an easy recommendation. What fans loved from past Sherlock Holmes instalments is still there, but you'll need to do a bit of overtime to find it.                            
87	                                With a unique presentation, engaging story, and solid mechanics, Voice of Cards: The Isle Dragon Roars is one of the best RPGs of the year.                            
85	                                Voice of Cards: The Isle Dragon Roars is a great JRPG with a very eye-catching visual style. The experience is full of quality, and it is a good introduction to Yoko Taro's creative mind.                             
85	                                If you’re looking for an enjoyable RPG with some novel ideas and strong presentation behind it, Voice of Cards can easily eat up a weekend or two. It’s sweet and doesn’t overstay its welcome, even when I wished it would. While those factors aren’t enough for it to match up against the best-in-class competitors, there are many worse ways to spend a cozy fall evening than curled up with Voice of Cards.                            
80	                                The strongest aspect of the game, however, is its storytelling, both in the main narrative and the smaller human stories seeded throughout the world. It may feel familiar if you’ve experienced other titles by creative director Yoko Taro: you can expect macabre character stories and moments that recontextualise the game’s events in dramatic ways. If there’s a reason to tolerate the parts that feel sluggish, it’s the story’s shocking third act and hidden endings, which deliver narrative payoff to the mysteries and moral quandaries you’ve encountered up to that point. This is a slow burn in every sense of the word, but offers a lot for those who stick with it. [Issue#8, p.94]                            
80	                                Voice of Cards: The Isle Dragon Roars may be simple, but it does a fantastic job of delivering a card game RPG hybrid that’s an absolute delight to play. Its aesthetic is second-to-none, its storytelling is excellent (largely due to Haberkorn’s fantastic narration), and its gameplay is deeply satisfying thanks to character development, rewarding exploration and engaging battles. If you’d like an RPG experience that differs from the norm, Square Enix has nailed it once again.                            
80	                                But those who take a chance on Voice of Cards might be surprised. Its tabletop style is endearing and a testament to the idea that gripping adventure transcends the need for cinematic cutscenes. Voice of Cards puts the "game" back in "role-playing game" in fun, compelling, and thoughtful ways that will delight players throughout their time with it.                             
80	                                Voice of Cards: The Isle Dragon Roars is like a cozy D&D-session on a dreary Autumn evening. The all-knowing and ever talking narrator takes you on an engaging adventure that unfolds according to the luck of the draw. Your own fantasy, and the immaculate writing from Nier-creator Yoko Taro take care of the rest.                            
80	                                Voice of Cards mixed JRPG's and board games' elements to offer a fun pretty unique experience. It is improvable in and far from perfect, but its originality and world deserve appreciation.                            
80	                                While Voice of Cards does stumble in spots, it shines as a brilliantly told story that successfully replicates the feeling of the best tabletop gaming sessions, with a game master whose engaging voice carries much of the emotion and tension required to make the setup work. While it certainly won't be for everyone, Voice of Cards: The Isle Dragon Roars is a beautiful title well worth a look from any roleplaying fan, and an example of how excellent design can breathe life into any game with enough to say about its world and its heroes.                            
80	                                Voice of Cards: The Isle Dragon Roars provides a gratifying experience with a distinct presentation, delightful soundtrack, and remarkable storytelling stellarly utilizing its tabletop context. Even when accounting for its lack of challenge and questionable character focus, it still manages to be a welcoming turn-based RPG any intrigued party can dive into without fear of obstruction.                            
76	                                Yoko Taro's storytelling is laid out on the table in a card-based adventure that'll appeal to tabletop and JRPG fans alike in Voice of Cards.                            
75	                                Still, I hesitate to recommend Voice of Cards: The Isle Dragon Roars to anyone other than Yoko Taro enthusiasts or players looking for a streamlined introduction to turn-based RPGs. The game is far too short, simple, and easy to maintain your attention for long, and its plot remains unmoving well beyond the point at which you’re likely to lose interest. Nonetheless, its compelling late-game narrative, charming graphical style, and superb score leave me cautiously optimistic about what a sequel can bring to the table. I just hope that the next time this dragon lands, it has learned lessons from its first, flawed foray.                            
75	                                Voice of Cards: The Isle Dragon Roars cloaks a very traditional JRPG in an alluring tabletop veneer. Sure, it doesn't really shake up the genre in any real meaningful way, but the unique presentation and laid back approach to player engagement all combine to make one of the more relaxing and easily accessible JRPG offerings to come along in a good while.                            
74	                                Voice of Cards: The Isle Dragon Roars is the sort of game that you'll play when you want a slow-paced and relaxing adventure; for that, it's an excellent experience. However, it can sometimes be bogged down by its gameplay's own indulgent vapidness.                            
70	                                The great presentation and music is what really makes the game shine, but the card battles could have done with some more thought.                            
70	                                When you’re climbing up to the fifth floor of a late-game dungeon while fighting battle after battle in a bland-looking environment, it’s tough to stay engaged or excited, even though it’s a relatively short experience overall.                            
70	                                Voice of Cards: The Isle Dragon Roars isn’t truly a card game, but a traditional RPG that uses cards for everything. The aesthetic choice doesn’t effect too much outside of the visuals but does give the title a unique identity. The gameplay of Voice of Cards is among the simplest and most straightforward to be seen in RPGs. It may be too simple, as battles end up feeling more like time -consuming chores due to the high encounter rate and lack of challenge or required strategy. But while the simple gameplay may not offer any challenge to RPG vets, the story and fantastic soundtrack help keep the game an enjoyable experience. The relatively short completion time is an asset in this case, making Voice of Cards a great choice when looking for a relaxing game to spend a weekend playing.                            
70	                                Voice of Cards: The Isle Dragon Roars is a great wasted opportunity: a triumph of playing cards accompanied by a wonderful soundtrack and a wonderful atmosphere, which however does not have time to breathe and arrives too quickly to the credits , without expanding your own story. An experiment which from the aesthetic point of view is an absolute success but which becomes too repetitive in playful terms and not very interesting in a narrative key.                             
70	                                Voice of Cards is undeniably fun to follow, especially thanks to its frankly successful “board game” aesthetic. However, he fails to fully engage the player in his adventure, the fault of overly simplistic and intrusive fights. This leaves a very nice game, often funny and enjoyable to play, but unfortunately punctuated by moments of trouble.                             
70	                                Thankfully, the game's excellent presentation holds everything together, and at around 12 hours in length, Voice of Cards doesn't quite outstay its welcome. There are multiple endings to unlock as well, but additional playthroughs may be a tall order. Voice of Cards isn't the kind of RPG that you can rush through — its deliberately slow pace is part of the charm — but there is a slightly expanded New Game+ mode for those who fancy taking on the dragon all over again.                            
70	                                We wish Voice of Cards took the time to explore its gameplay ideas a bit more. We also wish there were a few menu options to accelerate battle pace when you know what you’re doing. But as-is? There’s a lot here to love, if you have the right temperament for it.                            
70	                                A traditional turn-based role-player which utilises its tabletop disguise with charm and polish, but isn’t long enough to fully capitalise on its ideas.                            
65	                                The Voice of Cards: The Isle Dragon Roars is not what I expected and ultimately not what I wanted. I was hoping for a card game but a card game it is not. It's a classic RPG, simply presented solely in the medium of cards. But even taken for what it is, it falls too short of the running time of a good RPG, fails to deliver the challenge or strategy to make itself stand out in that genre, and tarnishes and excellent story with characters that struggle to redeem their faults.                            
60	                                Voice of Cards: The Isle Dragon Roars features a striking and quirky tabletop style with delightful gameplay that doesn’t overcomplicate things. While the storyline won’t necessarily grip you, it’s told in a fun and interactive way and this is an easygoing pick up and play title that you can enjoy at your own pace. You won’t be challenged when going card-to-card against your enemies, but you can still find the thrill of a frustrating hand if you delve into the minigame.                             
80	                                When it comes down to it, Astria Ascending is a charming blend of new and old, and a very enjoyable RPG experience overall. I'm always happy when I see a game successfully emulate the spirit of the ever-sacred old-school RPG, and I can happily say that Artisan Studios really outdid themselves with this one.                            
75	                                Astria Ascending will take many gamers back to the heyday of classic RPGs. This is a single-player turn-based game that is easy to grasp, with perhaps not enough challenge for veterans of the genre. But with an entertaining story, great musical score, and pleasing art style, there is plenty of enjoyment to be had for any RPG fan. Play Astria Ascending when you want to be completely absorbed into a game with no strings (or services) attached.                            
70	                                Astria Ascending is a gorgeous, very ambitious and at the same time flawed experience. It has deep mechanics, but their implementation could have used some more attention. The graphics are as gorgeous as some tracks are memorable, but sometimes they are out of sync. The background story is rich, yet the game fails to use it, making you do to the very same actions in different locations.If you like old school JRPGs you will overlook the shortcomings and have a good time with the game. If you never had a soft spot for the game best represented by Final Fantasy, Astria Ascending will not make you fall in love with the genre.                            
70	                                For a game with so many valid criticisms, a recommendation might not seem forthcoming, but Astria Ascending rises above all of these issues as a total experience, with the art alone making worth the price of admission. The character customization gives a feeling of constant, incremental progress that fulfills the effort put in. There’s always a new skill to learn, a new strategy to try. It would have been nice if the story was better and if the dungeon exploration was less frustrating, but this is a game that’s well worth the time for any fan of JRPGs, especially since it’s being sold at a lower price than most new titles. So long as the player knows what they’re getting into, then there’s too much superlative stuff in this package to ignore.                            
65	                                Thanks to the beauty of its graphics and music, Astria Ascending has an undeniable charm. Far from being content to be a beautiful postcard, the title does not forget to offer solid RPG mechanics to offer a tough challenge to fans of the genre. Unfortunately, its overly classic course and ergonomic concerns make the adventure at times laborious, at least to detract from the enjoyment of the player. Nonetheless, it remains a nice title which, behind its flaws, has an atmosphere that will delight those nostalgic for old-fashioned J-RPGs.                             
50	                                Astria Ascending is not a great JRPG. I would hesitate to label it a good one. In a year of winners, it's not a complete outlier but it's no contemporary classic. Despite a few flirtations with intrigue, the story is generally vacant of anything compelling enough to stick around until the credits. Poor writing compounds the problem and unlikable characters can't overcome it. Gameplay ranges from strong to stale, with just enough gumption and innovation to keep things lively. Pound for pound and for all its pedigree, this is a disappointing experience I'm not inclined to recommend.                            
50	                                Astria Ascending is a beautifully hand-drawn game with an old school JRPG feel. It tries to keep the experience modern with some much needed quality of life improvements, but annoying bugs hold it back. It’s a bit of a shame that the story is fairly forgettable but the fun combat system does help alleviate this to an extent. With a very detailed job system and plenty of optional side content to get involved with, there is entertainment to be found here if don’t mind the grind — but as an overall role-playing adventure, Astria Ascending has clear flaws.                            
40	                                Astria Ascending has the makings of a great game, but it falls short on several fronts. A version of the game that started out at an earlier point in the story, in order to gradually introduce each character and their abilities, would have helped smooth the transition into the main quest. A number of QoL improvements, especially related to the speed of the battles, would also drastically improve the gameplay. As it stands, Astria Ascending feels like a throwback to a different era, while needlessly ignoring the modern conveniences that have improved the genre in the time that has passed since then.                            
100	                                Hot Wheels Unleashed is how you make a toys-to-life video game. Milestone have taken some of the finest collectables and made them photo-realistic, unleashing them on racetracks that will blow your mind with the level of detail and craziness in equal measure. Exemplifying the “kart racer” genre, it is the natural progression of why we fall in love with this type of racing game over and over. This is a love letter to both Hot Wheels and arcade racing fans.                             
97	                                ‘Hot Wheels Unleased’ is as close as you can get to a kid’s dream (or at least mine). There are some slightly clunky things like the track builder at first, but once you get past the learning curve you’re able to set sail and take the wheel. It handles like a dream.                            
95	                                The overall feeling of Hot Wheels Unleashed is that it is a huge win for nostalgia fans and racing fans alike. From the graphical detail of the world to the tracks to the cars everything is spot on with how you remember these cars looking. The control you have while racing puts Hot Wheels Unleashed right up there with some of the other AAA racing titles.                             
90	                                Milestone awakes our nostalgia for the beloved Hot Wheels from our childhood with this extremely well designed, addictive and beautiful game.                            
90	                                Hot Wheels Unleashed is one of the most entertaining racing games of the year and a love letter to fans of this franchise. Without a doubt, an unmissable entry.                            
90	                                Not only a blast of die-cast nostalgia, but a brilliant arcade racer to boot with superb customisation options.                            
86	                                Hot Wheels Unleashed brings to consoles the same feeling that we had when we played with the toys in our childhood. The variety of vehicles is wide (even when there aren't many legendary ones), and both the cars and circuits work well. Overall, this is a great arcade racing game and a great surprise.                            
85	                                With more cars than you can shake a bit of plastic track at and a driving model that’s surprisingly good for an arcade racer, Hot Wheels Unleashed is an excellent racer that punches well above its weight.                            
83	                                A tavern full of toy cars to have fun with thanks to a fun and clean arcade driving model.                             
80	                                A fun arcade racer that provides added value for those willing to get their hands dirty. However, those who just want to race might find the experience a limited one. Buy into the whole creative side and it’ll make you feel like a kid again, especially if you’re the type that likes to collect.                            
80	                                Hot Wheels Unleashed has everything it takes to become a cult hit: a fine driving experience, a story mode, a track builder and you can unlock and collect rare cars. More than that, it's the racing game we didn't know we needed this year.                            
80	                                Hot Wheels Unleashed is an excellent arcade racing game with some truly inventive and crazy tracks, wonderfully recreated Hot Wheels toys that drive beautifully and the visuals to back it all up. Unfortunately an imbalance of reasonably long to extremely long tracks and their many hazard risks make it too easy to get frustrated when struggling to reach top spot, and the track builder while very well detailed fails to make the user experience anything but pleasant.                            
80	                                In its best moments, Hot Wheels Unleashed feels like a rollercoaster, albeit with a greater ability to steer the action. These are the Hot Wheels tracks you dreamed of zipping through when you were a kid, ramping off buildings, or accelerating through your home’s air ducts. The breakneck speeds and delightfully silly tracks don’t make this incredibly sophisticated, but it’s one of the more amusing racers to hit the starting line in some time.                            
80	                                Despite some balancing issues and some issues with how cars are obtained, Hot Wheels Unleashed is still a ton of fun thanks to its breakneck-speed racing, a detailed track editor that would make your inner child jealous, awesome collectible cars, and packed single-player content. Add in the nostalgia for playing with Hot Wheels cars and tracks as a kid, and you might find it to be one of 2021’s hidden gems.                            
80	                                Hot Wheels Unleashed is a bit light on level and event type variety but still delivers a great racer worthy of the Hot Wheels name with plenty of speed, detailed customization, and a meaty roster of fun vehicles.                            
80	                                Hot Wheels Unleashed is a fantastic arcade racer at its core, but the overall product is hurt by the gacha mechanics. Thankfully, the quality of the core game is good enough to largely overcome that handicap, but it would be a far better experience with rebalancing in that regard down the line. The racing action is fast-paced and thrilling, with strong sound design that helps make up for a lackluster soundtrack. Hot Wheels Unleashed is a fantastic pickup for anyone who grew up wanting a fleet of Hot Wheels cars — and that aspect will get better as time goes on with content packs.                            
80	                                Hot Wheels Unleashed marks the return of toy cars to consoles and PC, with a noteworthy title.                            
80	                                It may be based on a particular brand of die-cast toy cars aimed at kids, but Hot Wheels Unleashed is a fun arcade-style racer suitable for all ages and, for the most part, skill levels. Bursting with content, it’ll be a while before you’ve grown tired of its many tracks and unlocked all of the 60-plus cars that it offers. Throw in online and offline multiplayer, a track builder, and gameplay that’s easy to pick up but has some additional depth for more skilled players, and you have a package that’s easy to recommend.                            
78	                                The game is more like an arcade title than a full-featured racer. The game is clearly focused on collecting cars and expanding your collection rather than providing an extensive and full-featured racing game experience. The arcade racing is fun in short bursts, but the blind box system can make it feel like a grind while trying to obtain the cars that you want. If you pick this game up, do it for the car collecting. Otherwise, there are more enjoyable arcade racers with more variety out there for you to play.                            
78	                                Hot Wheels Unleashed is a fun arcade racer, with plenty of options and that old-school gameplay that feels great if you miss this type of game.                            
78	                                Hot Wheels Unleashed is a fast-paced racer that captures the frantic action of the miniature, diecast toys. The momentum-based gameplay helps to create intense races where anyone can win or lose. Even though the tracks are exciting and varied, the lack of environments is disappointing. Vehicles look incredible, making you want to collect each of them, however, the grindy blind box system may halt your progress. Overall, this is a solid racer that will knock you over with a nitro-boost of nostalgia.                            
75	                                Hot Wheels Unleashed is, at times, a dream come true. Milestone has managed to capture the essence of Mattel's toys with a complete title full of content, a fantastic editor —that will give a lot thanks to the community— and a complex driving system where drifting is fundamental. Despite some improvable physics and design decisions based on random content and gambling (loot boxes), the result is more than remarkable, satisfactory and, therefore, recommended for fans of the genre. In addition, the performance of its online mode has surprised us for the better.                            
75	                                Hot Wheels Unleashed is a super fun yet sometimes frustrating arcade racer that is hindered slightly by some design shortcomings.                            
73	                                Hot wheels Unleashed is, in some respects, a brilliant arcade driving video game. Simple, immediate, fun and just enough adrenaline, supported by an excellent technical department and which offers one of the best circuit editors that have been seen in recent years. However, it is not explained how such a well-made title can be inserted in such a cumbersome and counterintuitive menu system, in addition to the fact that in the face of an excellent interpretation of the Hot Wheels brand on an aesthetic level, it contradicts itself so evidently with the its management of the lootboxes, the underlying mechanics of the title that has influenced its internal balance in a way that is at least questionable.                            
72	                                If you're a fan of arcade racers, Hot Wheel Unleashed is a fun game for a rainy weekend. However, the game has little to do with the basics of Hot Wheels. Collecting the coolest cars is also hell because of the available Blind Boxes.                             
70	                                For a first draft from Milestone on this license, this Hot Wheels Unleashed is doing with a positive result. This is mainly due to a well-studied drive and rather well-designed circuits that respect the spirit of small friction cars. Once the driving is mastered, it is fun to go from boost to boost, studying the best way to use nitro and optimize trajectories. We can hope that this constitutes an encouraging basis to make it a real must-have on a future version. There are unfortunately too many flaws that reveal an imperfect finish.                             
70	                                All-in-all, Hot Wheels Unleashed is an incredibly fun racer which will get its hooks in you and have you behind the die-cast wheel for hours on end. It includes a comprehensive track builder which you can use to let your imagination run wild and an extensive car collection which will keep your eyes firmly on the plastic orange track. It's the ultimate virtual Hot Wheels experience, whether you want to create your most fantastical Hot Wheels tracks, or just race long into the night playing split screen or multiplayer with a friend. There really is something for everyone here, and Hot Wheels Unleashed is a welcome addition to Mattel's long-running Hot Wheels video game franchise.                             
70	                                Honestly, I really didn’t expect much out of Hot Wheels Unleashed. I was expecting a throw-away licensed racing game. Perhaps, more cynically, a cash-grab targeting nostalgic aging gamers. What I ended up getting, though, was a surprisingly solid arcade racer by a team that obviously cares about the license they’re working with. It’s not without its quirks, unfortunately. The shocking aggressive AI racers created many moments of frustration, and I’m not a fan of the “gacha but not really” system going on here for obtaining new cars. But for fans of arcade racers, whether the Hot Wheels name strikes a chord or not, Hot Wheels Unleashed is a game worth a look.                            
70	                                Hot Wheels Unleashed  tries to bring back the memories of childhood with a fast and colored game. Unfortunately it does not succeed completely, resulting too simple and repetitive.                             
70	                                It remains an effective game, quite enjoyable and is without doubt the one that most faithfully respects the spirit of the famous brand, with that same nostalgic and passionate vision that we could have had ourselves, a few years earlier.                            
70	                                Hot Wheels Unleashed is a rock solid arcade racing game that gets a lot of things right, but doesn't quite measure up in some areas. The drift-heavy handling and physics-based mayhem create super fun action on the track, and the cars themselves are as good to look at as they are to drive. While the tracks tend to feel a bit samey and the random nature of unlocks may lead to some frustration, the end result is a robust racing game that'll appeal to fans young and old.                            
62	                                Hot Wheels Unleashed is an okay racing game at best. If you want a much more enjoyable arcade-style racer with your favourite childhood toys then check out Beach Buggy Racing 2: Island Adventure which has its very own Hot Wheels Booster Pack DLC.                            
60	                                Hot Wheels Unleashed is really nice to look at and sometimes fun to play, but I’m not sure who it’s for. The in-game currency model is unnecessarily convoluted and annoying most of the time. The difficulty is unbalanced to the point where I was forced to play on easy and swallow my gamer pride. The online multiplayer is where the most enjoyment is, but expect to invest hours trying to pull a car that can compete with some of the rarer racers. If Unleashed were a contender in a race, it would place 12th, like I did many times.                            
60	                                Hot Wheels Unleashed delivers on what it promises, high octane toy car thrills, drifting and boosting around gravity defying tracks set in high definition great looking environments. It just lets itself down when it comes to the structure of the solo campaign and there aren’t enough unique hazards or variation in the tracks to keep you coming back for more. It would have been nice if they went a step further and thought outside of the box with the designs of the tracks themselves, but at least it delivers a boost of nostalgia for the kid inside all of us.                            
58	                                Even with an outstanding Hot Wheels license to work with, Hot Wheels Unleashed’s generic and uninspired execution coupled with lower presentation qualities makes it a below average racing title.                            
55	                                Hot Wheels Unleashed is initially a pretty fun arcade racer, with decent controls, as well as a nice connection between soundtrack and gameplay. After a while, the game starts to get tedious, though. Uninspired tracks, annoying enemy AI and a large amount of filler content ultimately prove Hot Wheels Unleashed's downfall.                            
50	                                While everything is perfectly playable, for a game that absolutely nails the toy’s aesthetic it’s almost remarkable how removed the gameplay feels from the fiery, fast-paced action that has come to embody the brand. Never mind hot, these little wheels are lukewarm at best. [Issue#7, p.90]                            
50	                                Outside of its stunning visuals, Hot Wheels Unleashed is a toothless kart racer, relying too heavily on nostalgia goggles and the Hot Wheels brand to carry it instead of the solid ideas that end up hardly being implemented. What players get with Hot Wheels Unleashed is the same experience I had with many of my Hot Wheels as a child; I was entertained for a few hours, then grew bored and tossed it in a box. That’s not to say that I didn’t have fun with the game. Those few hours were full of spectacle, because it’s simply impossible to not get caught up in the game’s sights and sounds. Eventually, though, it’s going to take more than racing a hot dog car down a strip of vinyl track to keep me interested.                            
80	                                Medieval Dynasty is a survival RPG that manages to stand out in the oversaturated market that it occupies. By combining ideas from several other popular franchises, developer Render Cube has managed to create a genuinely unique product. Its story hardly stacks up against AAA RPGs like The Elder Scrolls but it's good enough given the game's many other strengths.                            
80	                                Medieval Dynasty is a gorgeous survival/crafting and town management adventure game that satisfies our primal urge to create, build and form a community. After spending a year in early access, the ‘full release’ definitely has a solid foundation, but some mechanics could have used a bit more time in the oven. If you’re prepared for a long term investment, you’ll reap a fantastic reward.                             
78	                                A special blend of Survival and Single-Player RPG gameplay with beautiful graphics and interesting management mechanics, whose rather empty and generic medieval world ends up detracting from the whole experience.                            
75	                                Medieval Dynasty is a big peculiar mix of survival, resource management and RPG that feels medieval enough to be worth a try, despite some huge balance problems.                            
75	                                Like some sort of peasant Animal Crossing, Medieval Dynasty casts us in the role of mayor of Dysentery Village. You’ll slowly grow from labor-intensive shacks to a semi-self-sufficient hamlet through the sweat of your brow, building a dynasty that will last generations. You’ll just wish your peons would pitch in and carry their own water...and stop eating the buckets.                            
75	                                Medieval Dynasty won’t reinvent the wheel of the survival or resource management genres, but it will give you a relaxing and low-key experience you can customize to your liking. Its story and UI set it back from truly shining, but its focus on building a village and surviving through the seasons will keep you coming back for hours of simple entertainment.                            
74	                                Medieval dynasty is a fun, relaxing survival RPG, even if it's not always exciting.                            
74	                                Medieval Dynasty is a motivating medieval city builder from the first person perspective, in which players have many things to do. The world, however, just doesn't feel alive.                            
70	                                Medieval Dynasty isn’t meant to be rushed, rather, to be an experience and a personal challenge for those that want to see how long they can rule and keep the peace within their kingdom. While there are still clearly some stark improvements that can be made, I think that Medieval Dynasty succeeded in bringing something new to an already saturated and stale genre, and can be a lasting favorite, as long as they continue to make improvements and provide updates.                             
70	                                Medieval Dynasty is far from perfect, but it's captivating and intriguing in its own and peculiar way.                            
70	                                An interesting mix of different mechanics that quickly becomes somehow boring in its micro-management antics.                            
70	                                Render Cube studio has prepared a very pleasant and relaxing game. Medieval Dynasty is like a distant cousin of Animal Crossing - an FPP game on a budget, without multiplayer, but available on PC. It's worth playing once version 1.0 debuts. If you're new to this game and genre, I assure you - it is a survival like no other.                            
60	                                Medieval Dynasty feels unfinished in many ways. Yes, it looks amazing and does a great job bringing the middle ages to life. The negatives overshadow the positives, however. The story is missing synchronization and traveling the vast distances between villages is exhausting because of missing fast travel points. There are many more things that really frustrated us. If you are not in for the interesting setting, there’s really not that much here to have fun with.                            
93	                                Sable's lonely, heartfelt journey of self-discovery will sit with me for a lifetime.                            
90	                                Sable plays like a young person's diary, full of hope and apologies, staying grounded while reaching for stars. It trades in its combat for climbing puzzles instead, and isn't afraid to let you bunny hop across a mustard-yellow desert or stand perfectly still—with the encouraging words of people recounting their own wonder years.                            
90	                                Sable is a little rough around the edges, then, yet these shortcomings are far outweighed by its numerous strengths. This is a relaxing adventure that's both familiar and quite unlike anything else. It gives you the freedom to approach things at your own pace--in your own way--while managing to dispel any notions of aimlessness. Even if you don't have a particular objective in mind, you're guaranteed to discover new sights and sounds by hopping on your hoverbike and simply exploring. It's the antithesis to most open-world design, where the onus is on getting you to the next point of interest as soon as possible, and so it stands out even if you remove its beautiful art style from the equation. Sable is methodical, introspective, comforting, and fully deserving of your time.                            
90	                                Striking, peaceful, and wholly focused on exploring at your own pace, Sable is a joy to play. The optimization could use some serious work, but this is an extremely compelling game that offers a better open-world experience than many AAA developers have crafted.                            
90	                                Sable is high on the list of game of the year contenders in one jam packed with them. It’s a gorgeous, immersive coming of age story that happens organically and at your own pace - you can see as much or as little of the game as you like. While it certainly has its share of issues, Midden is just a place you have to visit.                             
90	                                Playing Sable very well may be as close as one can get to a meditative experience while playing a game. Few games feel as good to simply exist within as Sable. The game’s gorgeous visuals, warm and comforting music, and intuitive game design all come together to create a unique experience about trying to find one’s place in the world through an expression of an individual’s freedom.                             
90	                                For those yearning to explore, Sable offers the chance to do it at your own speed, with your own goals, and without the need to exert violence or experience shocking twists. Sable is confident the world is interesting enough and is completely right in that regard.                            
90	                                The occasional bug and missing stamina upgrades are really the only negatives I can lodge at Sable. I can think of very few games that have presented such a beautiful harmony of its attributes. Everything supports everything else. The story implores you to go out into the world, to see all that there is to see. The gameplay ensures that the focus is always on the vistas that lay before you, and it's all stylised beautifully. The game creates a view of which I cannot tire. This is truly one of the most well-conceived and executed games that I have seen in a very long time. It's one of those games that truly is using everything to its maximum potential.

88	                                Sable ends in the same way it starts, at home with family. The narrative payoff is not actually about your final choice, and that may rub more goal-oriented players the wrong way. However, I found the conclusion a fitting end to a side quest-filled exploration game. For those who love to explore, I can’t recommend Sable enough. Every element – beautiful graphics, compelling traversal, and player-driven plot – works together to ensure I simply lose myself in the world.                             
80	                                Anyone willing to bury their head in the sand for the many technical problems will find Sable a stunning and relaxed open world game. Since the emphasis is purely on exploring a desert, the laid-back vibe is never interrupted by combat, crafting, or other unnecessary pursuits.                             
80	                                This is a barren world, but rendered exquisitely, drawing careful inspiration from French cartoonist Jean “Moebius” Giraud in its blend of space and intricacy. Exploring its crannies delivers a slow-burn joy. Developed by a small team from north London (Shedworks, because the two founders began work in a garden shed), Sable is an unusual expression of the so-called “open world” – the dominant video game genre today. Most lead you in certain directions, ensuring you approach landmarks from the best angles, matching every plot beat with a suitable musical flourish. Here, by contrast, you are totally free to explore wherever, whenever, however you wish. There are whispered points of interest, but there is no wearying to-do list, and as such your journey and destination are uniquely, wonderfully personal.                            
80	                                Sable features a wonderful open world presented in a gorgeous art style that gives you complete freedom in working out who you are.                            
80	                                Sable is not just an iteration on open-world design, but a true spiritual successor to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.                            
80	                                The problems, although minor for the most part, were encountered with such regularity that they can’t be overlooked. Hopefully, Raw Fury will fix these hiccups quickly because, without those flaws, Sable truly is a beautiful and minimalist journey through an open world that is a joy to explore.                            
80	                                Making an interactive facsimile of Moebius’ style is a daunting task. While it isn’t always a slam dunk, Sable provides handsome eye candy, encouraging you to climb mountains for the view alone. The anticipated score from Japanese Breakfast is even more versatile, stringing the wasteland with theremin, accordions, shoegaze and desert psych. It’s a shame that the initial glider sounds like loose change in a dryer, so I encourage players strictly seeking to vibe to trade up for better parts as soon as they can.                            
80	                                Quotation forthcoming.                            
80	                                Sable is a dual-soul game that we all really enjoyed overall. Unfortunately it is not perfect and it pays a little for the inability to better implement some game mechanics, which may even work, but which almost clash with the rest of the experience.                            
80	                                Sable is downright beautiful in its execution and storytelling, and captures an innate desire for exploration like few other open-world games.                            
80	                                Sable borrows a popular and tried and tested approach to open-world game design and gives it a truly unique feel indicative of the works of the French artist Moebius. The lack of combat may turn some off from playing the game—however, for those looking for a casual game where exploration and light puzzle-solving comes first, it's hard not to recommend Sable.                            
80	                                A sweetly told tale of youth, travel, and self-discovery that's not afraid to wear its inspirations on its sleeve. In turbulent, inward-looking times, Sable is a true comfort.                            
80	                                Sable is a beautiful story about self-discovery. It’s themes of solitude and what it means to be independent strongly resonated with me. The game is bolstered by a one-of-a-kind art style and an excellently crafted original soundtrack. If you can handle a slow burn and push some UI issues aside, Sable is an overwhelmingly pleasant experience.                            
80	                                With its beautiful design, surprisingly deep lore, and comforting soundtrack, Sable provides a joyful and inspiring escape that would be a shame to miss out on.                            
78	                                Sable is a fascinating coming of age videogame with an incredible art direction inspired by the works of the late Jean Giraud.                            
78	                                The stylish exploration adventure full of beautiful areas manages todelight even without combat. However, the gaming experience is currentlyimpaired by bugs.                            
77	                                Sable offers a very unique concept, so if you’re happy to get lost in its world of discovery, you will enjoy it.                            
75	                                Sable is a fascinating and unique journey that lets the player discover the world of Midden and face a poetic but pretty empty open world.                            
74	                                I think that whether you enjoy Sable will very much depend on your mood and expectations. Some gamers will appreciate it for the chill, Zen-like, conflict-and-combat-free, emotionally resonant story that it absolutely is. Other gamers may grow impatient with its lack of real incident, and weary of the pace and absence of challenge. I tend to land in the latter camp. Sable is a beautiful game, but it needs to rev up the dramatic engine or raise the stakes for the player to keep fidgety gamers like me engaged.                            
70	                                There’s something to be said of Sable’s casual, meditative charm and truly enchanting presentation. Unfortunately, however, it can occasionally feel empty and remains fraught with technical errors and performance issues. Hopefully, there'll be a bug-fixing patch on the horizon. Otherwise, Sable's fresh, intriguing world and solid mechanics could be overshadowed by its assortment of glitches.                            
70	                                If at times Sable has a certain adolescent clumsiness about it, elsewhere it feels mature beyond its years. [Issue#364, p.106]                            
70	                                If you are into experimental games, you will find countless things in the desert of Midden that deserve to be found and will burn into your memory. However, if you have some difficulties with rather quiet and minimalistic stories and wish for an intense and huge adventure like Breath of the Wild, you might be disappointed. Sable is a small-scale project with a lot of heart that only works if you are actually willing to surrender to emptiness and peace. But trust us, it’s definitely worth your time.                            
70	                                If the idea of a game that offers you a true sense of freedom appeals to you, you’ll undoubtedly get a kick out of Sable. Its expertly-crafted narrative alone will inspire you to keep going, but repetitive quests and an often barren world may dampen your spirits a little. Still, there’s a lot to enjoy here, and if its art style resonates with you, you’ll find it easy to lose hour after hour in Sable‘s unique world.                            
70	                                A visual tribute to Mœbius, Sable seduces first of all with its captivating features and colors. He is also granted an exploration rich in great freedom and some gripping mysteries. But the sawtooth technique is terribly lacking on the trip. And the universe lacks a certain consistency, struggling to engage us completely during its long stroll.                             
70	                                Sable is a beautiful, minimalist voyage that’s hindered by bugs and bland puzzles.                            
70	                                Sable is a truly wondrous and serene experience at times, but lift the mask and you find it's also one that has its flaws and inconveniences. If you can see past its weaknesses, this is a journey of pure and innocent discovery that's well worth taking.                            
70	                                When it comes to sound design and visual style, Sable blew me away. I couldn’t help but smile and prepare to get lost in a beautiful world. Unfortunately, that feeling doesn’t take long to fade away. There’s definitely enough to keep you engaged and interested, but I just yearned to get more out of this game, especially as it has compelling elements within the groundwork.                            
65	                                The obvious flaws of Sable eliminate the possibility of presenting all these ideas in a coherent and engaging adventure from start to finish. The open structure of the narrative and gameplay, however, allow to calibrate the overall experience on the user's desire to immerse themselves in a story that is as fascinating as it is imperfect.                             
60	                                Because the atmosphere encompasses so much of Sable’s appeal, the technical issues can be absolutely ruinous.                            
60	                                Sable’s premise is novel, if not entirely new. Its minimalistic gameplay, at times, helps sell a more personable experience. Regrettably, the minimalism cuts both ways as Sable’s barren world betrays the game’s emphasis on exploration.                            
60	                                There’s plenty to like about Sable but ultimately, this isn’t for everyone. Due to performance issues, weak endings, lack of direction and a failure to explain key elements, several flaws hold it back. However, by offering strong narrative freedom, enjoyable exploration without combat, and a unique visual approach, Sable still felt quite refreshing in some regards. Ultimately, it’s an entertaining debut by Shedwork and if you can look past those flaws, it comes recommended.                            
60	                                They say every journey starts with a single step, but in the case of Sable, the journey starts with the arduous task of assembling a motorbike. Sable is a game that looks gorgeous and occasionally does gorgeous things, but too often it's a drab and lifeless affair. It’s a game that knows exactly how it makes you want to feel, but it doesn’t quite have the gameplay to pull it off, and that means it’s constantly fighting with itself.                            
60	                                Its messages certainly resonated with me but its gameplay lacked the variety to truly keep me hooked for lengthier sessions. If you're looking for a chill experience and can overlook any performance issues that aren't quite resolved by the time you pick it up, then Sable will deliver. I just can't help shake the feeling of missed potential here.                            
60	                                There’s nothing wrong with a game about doing simple things, and enjoying a relaxing journey in between, but in Sable, we could never relax.                            
50	                                Sable is a visually interesting game with a unique concept and setting, but uninspired gameplay, sparse characterization and a staggering number of technical issues prevent it from realizing most of its lofty goals.                            
50	                                Sable should be applauded for its strong aesthetic choices and ambitious restructure of open-world priorities, but it fails to fully deliver on its premise and is ultimately undone by a lack of polish or engaging mechanics.                             
100	                                Even with that gripe, Lost in Random just does so much right that it doesn't even really matter. I wouldn't trade my experience in the game for anything, and I'd be willing to get lost in the world of Random all-over gain. If you're on the fence, trust me, just roll the dice and jump on in, because you won't regret it.                            
90	                                Lost in Random is clearly a Zoink! game, though you can't compare it to other games from the studio. The game has its own style and gameplay and both of them are truly wonderful. If you like card games, dice games, or are simply addicted to adventuring this is the game for you. The game feels like a Tim Burton movie. Funny, but creepy and stylish at the same time. Lost in Random is truly compelling with an original story and once you start, you can't stop playing.                            
86	                                The story grabs you immediately and maintains a steady drip-feeding of excitement throughout its playtime and the game is just overall a refined, lovingly crafted adventure that will appeal to even those who are generally turned off by “card battle” games, as the content and gameplay here goes much deeper than that.                            
85	                                It doesn’t seem random that Lost in Random is a great game. The developers put a lot of thought into crafting a fantastic gaming experience alongside a grim storybook adventure. It all works incredibly well with only a few dips of quality that will surely be fixed over time. I enjoyed this experience thoroughly as it delivers on its action-adventure and haphazard gameplay systems.                            
85	                                Full of character and charm, Lost in Random is a witty and enjoyable tale that at times, mimics our own. It's eerily beautiful, well made and fans of board games will fall in love with it. The combat system is rewarding and has just enough nuance to keep it interesting until the end. So roll your dice and take a chance on Lost in Random. It is a unique game amongst its current peers.                            
85	                                Gothic fairytale stylings and unique mish-mash of systems come together into yet another great example of Zoink's boundless creativity and game design chops. Fans of Burton-esque worlds and tabletop tropes would do well to get Lost in Random.                            
85	                                From the artistic direction to the narration, passing through the combat system, Lost in Random stages a suggestive contrast between order and chaos. A modern dark fairy tale that owes much of its aesthetic to the imagery of Nightmare Before Christmas and Coraline, Lost in Random will undoubtedly conquer lovers of Tim Burton's works. Capable of entertaining, amusing, but also disturbing, the Indie by Zoink Games is absolutely recommended to all players looking for a good Action Adventure full of ideas and original solutions.                             
83	                                This shadowy adventure will get you in the mood for Halloween all year around with its atmospheric design, creative combat system, and well-crafted story.                            
80	                                Lost In Random’s unique and compelling qualities go deeper than the wonderful art design. Trust us, roll the dice on a purchase, and you will not be disappointed. [Issue#7, p.84]                            
80	                                Lost in Random feels just like a hand full of wonderful cards – and then some of them don’t work the way you’d expect. The art style is a triumph, as are the characters and the story setting. This would be a proper jewel - if only it wasn’t for the combat system which is, to put it plainly, just too random.                            
80	                                Lost In Random is a delightful, sprawling action adventure set in a dark but fun Tim Burton-esque universe. Its combat doesn't always hold up but exploring its worlds absolutely does.                            
80	                                Lost in Random is a magical adventure, and though its dice and card-based combat system never achieves a significant depth at which it could, its still a worthwhile journey. Zoink’s strength lies in building wonderous, mysterious, and frankly just weird characters and worlds. Hand-in-hand with Even and Dicey, you won’t be disappointed at getting lost in Random.                            
80	                                A dark and comical action adventure with excellent combat mechanics, sharp writing, and a memorable cast of characters.                            
80	                                Thanks to its absolutely sublime art style, excellent voice acting and its dark, fairytale-like narrative, Lost in Random is a wonderful adventure that will have you gripped. It’s a shame there’s no lip syncing to really finish off the visuals, and combat can be a little frustrating at times, but in the grand scheme of things these are miniscule issues. There’s so much originality and charm here that it’s hard not to fall in love with the world of Random.                            
80	                                Lost in Random is easily one of the more unique games I’ve played recently. Offering an entertaining fusion of deck-builders and real-time combat, Zoink’s done well in realising their vision. Thanks to chance-based combat, lack of enemy variety and some long-winded dialogue with NPCs, it's not perfect, but ultimately, the positives outweigh these points. With some strong combat customisation, a captivating story and excellent art style, Lost in Random comes highly recommended.                            
80	                                Lost in Random enjoys an exquisite universe, between an artistic direction reminiscent of the golden age of stop motion and a particularly rich narration. Add to that combat mechanics cleverly built and well executed despite some redundancies and some under-exploited ideas. But in the end, Zoink offers us a fascinating macabre tale that never runs out of steam over time and is worth browsing.                             
80	                                Lost in Random is set in a masterfully crafted world which tells a gothic fairy tale-like story that has plenty of warmth despite its dark hue. With beautiful writing and a touching story, it does a great job at making you really care about what happens to Even, as well as everyone she meets. It also has a truly unique battle system that offers loads of fun in your quest to create a perfect deck. This is a delight to play from beginning to end.                            
80	                                Despite some clunky movement, Lost in Random features smart combat and a world filled with wonder, mystery, and excitement.                            
79	                                Even with its faults, there's simply no denying just how special of a game Lost in Random is. From its awe-inspiring world to its ingenious gameplay, there's a lot to love in this incredible and memorable albeit often-frustrating adventure.                            
77	                                The moody Tim Burton look, the innovative combat system and the exceptional characters can't fully compensate for the lack of variety.                            
75	                                Lost in Random is a magical experience in several areas. The story, presentation, and world are a joy to experience from start to finish, with a few minor exceptions. On the other hand, the combat is initially refreshing but is hindered by the length of encounters and a lack of depth in its mechanics, so later encounters feel like a frustrating chore. It's a fun action-adventure in short bursts, and Lost in Random deserves much more attention than it has received.                            
75	                                As our minds turn toward more haunted holidays, it’s a good time to get lost in Random. Even’s commitment to her quest is enough to carry you through an awkwardly told story, and despite some parts of combat that feel too dependent on luck, the card-dice fights are truly unique. The pace of the journey, from drawn-out conversations to endings that cut you off from the best parts, befoul what is otherwise a fun world to explore.                            
75	                                Interesting and atmospheric, that’s Lost in Random in a nutshell. The unique combat system is also very much worth mentioning. The lack of variety and a number of technical issues do bring the experience down a bit.                            
70	                                Lost in Random offers a vivid world and unique bunch of characters, but some of the cities sadly feels pretty samey with not enough personality and variety.                            
70	                                Lost in Random is a beautiful Burton-esque fantasy that comes close to evoking the same levels of craft and character as its obvious inspirations. It doesn’t quite sustain the wonder from start to finish, but it remains an easy recommendation.                             
70	                                If you’re willing to overlook the bloated combat, you’ll find a lot to love in this macabre adventure about the bond between sisters.                            
70	                                I think that if you translated Lost in Random's dark narrative and engagingly strange visual style into a stop-motion animated style film, it would be a powerful exploration of a harrowing and at times poignant journey through an upside down world ruled by disorder. There's a lot of that in the game, too, but it's made less effective by tepid mechanics and tedious, unrewarding combat. The story and setting are absolutely worth experiencing, but there's probably a chance you'll be as disappointed by the gameplay as you are enchanted by the tale.                            
70	                                A Burton-esque adventure ruled by fate and dice that, despite an intriguing story and fascinating gothic visuals, misses the gameplay point with some boring design choices.                            
68	                                Lost in Random has very good ideas and a development that combines its gothic atmosphere with a combat system inspired by the best role-playing games. But, when you repeat the same process continuously, the sensations are more bitter.                            
60	                                Lost in Random mostly benefits from its "Tim Burtonesque" visuals and quirky design, but unfortunately the whole experience is dragged down by a tiring card-based battle system, with cards that are bland.                            
60	                                The game’s inventive and jokey writing goes a long way toward mitigating the frustrating linearity that takes over the campaign.                            
100	                                The Artful Escape is beautiful, sad, compelling and mind-blowing in equal measure. It’s more of a concept album than it is a game and that’s fine, because with so many set-pieces, such well-realised vignettes, and such awe-inspiring talent behind it, you’re more than happy to sit down and take in the journey as your fingers dance on the pad from time to time to keep the game moving forward. You’ve heard of prog rock music before, but this might be the first prog-rock game.                            
100	                                This one’s a no-brainer; The Artful Escape is on Xbox Game Pass and you absolutely, positively have no reason to miss it if you’re a subscriber. If you’re not and you enjoy warm fuzzies, either get on board or buy it outright as you won’t be disappointed.                            
95	                                The Artful Escape is a bold and beautiful trip through the cosmos, featuring a killer soundtrack and a thrilling space adventure.                            
90	                                When Francis played his final set and the credits started rolling, I was quite glad to have played The Artful Escape. It is very clearly Its Own Thing, and not only is that thing pretty awesome, it’s just one more example that videogames are able to deliver a huge array of experiences that are all worthwhile in their own way. I love that Beethoven & Dinosaur brought their vision to my screen, and if nothing else, maybe this rock-fueled journey through the stars will get developers off of movies and on to music videos for a while.                            
90	                                Annapurna Interactive has a staggering back catalogue, but 2021 has frankly not been great for the publisher. Last Stop failed to leave any kind of impact, Maquette is a game with Bryce Dallas Howard in it and not much else, and Twelve Minutes, despite being loaded with star-power, wastes its time loop mechanic in service of a ridiculous twist ending that derails the entire game. With The Artful Escape, plus Neon White, Stray, and Solar Ash to come in the near future, it feels like Annapurna is back.                             
90	                                The Artful Escape is a brash, bold and beautiful musical journey with a simplistic gameplay hook and all the interdimensional jellyfish deities you can shake a quantum-powered space guitar at. It's the next-best way to spend an afternoon indoors to dropping acid.                            
90	                                This is a moving postcard to the 70s and 80s as far as influence goes -- as if David Bowie, Pink Floyd and Genesis found each other on a moving platform designed by Terry Gilliam rapidly coasting through the far reaches of space, powered entirely by solar sails and positive thought, and decided to jam.                            
90	                                The Artful Escape is a beautiful and imaginative trip along the life and aspirations of a young guitarist. Close your eyes for a moment and relax, it will be a special one.                            
90	                                The Artful Escape is well worth the wait. An exciting, well-acted feast for the senses, it does not disappoint. There are a couple of technical issues that need to be sorted, but on the whole, games this imaginative and enthralling don't come along very often.                            
88	                                The Artful Escape is by turns psychedelic, moving, exultant, and lovely. The central metaphor of a young performer bringing fantastic new worlds into existence through the art of music is a powerful one, and while the theme of a struggling musician finding his authentic voice while paying homage to the past might not be a new one, it’s certainly new to videogames. The Artful Escape only missteps when it tries too hard to be a game, ironic given the story’s premise of search for authenticity. Aside from that, The Artful Escape is a surprising and joyous exploration of the power of collaboration, the struggle for identity, and the mind-blowing, life-altering sound of the very loud galactic symphony.                            
86	                                The Artful Escape (previously known as The Artful Escape of Francis Vendetti) is an upcoming platform video game being developed by Beethoven & Dinosaur.                            
85	                                A must for Xbox Game Pass subscribers, and absolutely recommended for everyone else, The Artful Escape of Francis Vendetti tells with irony and intelligence the path of artistic and inner growth of a talented teenage musician. Through the celestial bodies of the Stupefacosm, the protagonist and the player learn together to follow only the rhythm of their electric guitar, among extraordinarily inspired landscapes. Even in the face of a playful sector that does not represent the fulcrum of the work, the only regret remains a rhythm game soul that could have dared more. But in the face of the power of the proposed experience, we consider it a slight observation that we hope will be heard in a desirable second journey into the Stupefacosm.                             
85	                                The Artful Escape, aided by its ultra-accessible mechanics, is more of a visual journey. As an escape into Francis’ preoccupation, it does make sense for there to be no real challenge. He’s intentionally a Gary Stu in the story he’s weaving for himself and, because of the simplicity, The Artful Escape disarms the player with incomparable visuals, a terrific soundtrack, and a focus on themes like public image and the overlap of fantasy and reality. It’s not interactively demanding and variety is scarce, but at around four hours, it’s an afternoon well spent to vitalise the body and soul.                            
85	                                Like its protagonist, The Artful Escape leans into its unique identity and comes out the better for it. The game is breathtakingly beautiful, rich in music, and makes you feel like an intergalactic rock star while examining some thoughtful, relatable fears.                            
84	                                The Artful Escape is a game with a brave narrative, an original and unique artistic view, and excellent choice of voice casting and soundtrack. Even with some flaws, it's a must-have game.                             
83	                                The Artful Escape is a hard to define game. Light platform and rhythm’n’game elements are diluted inside a narrative driven gameplay that tasks the player with life and artistic choices. While the gameplay is bent to the main thematic of the game, visual and music take the mind of the player through an epic, psychedelic journey in a rock, sci-fi, over the top space opera.                             
80	                                The Artful Escape is, Galvatron has said, a 17-year-old’s conception of what it is to play in a rock band: musical transcendence meets universal adoration beneath the hot lights. But behind the shimmer, this is a touching tale of how to break free of the creative expectations of others. There is little traditional challenge here, but as a left-field power fantasy, few video games are so immediately stylish or so gratifying.                             
80	                                The Artful Escape is an enigmatic coming of age story, wrapped in reverb-laden riffs and space opera shenanigans. It is quite unique, and absolutely unmissable.                             
80	                                The Artful Escape is a wonderful audiovisual experience with a lot of great moments and a intense story. If you like this types of games, you should try it.                             
80	                                The Artful Escape certainly won’t tick all the boxes for everyone that comes through. It’s an abstract title that isn’t afraid to go against the grain in every capacity. From the visuals down to the actual mechanics, it’s unlike anything else on the market. But for that exact reason, it’s absolutely an experience worth your time. Creativity to this degree is rare in the modern gaming industry and therefore, The Artful Escape shouldn’t go amiss.                            
80	                                The Artful Escape is an unforgettable psychedelic journey. Its short length helps its simple mechanics stay fresh so you can focus on Francis’ journey and its stunning visuals. Perhaps fully embracing the medium could have made this something even more special, but it’s an experience all its own, and that’s okay. Much like the game tries to teach Francis, sometimes you can just have to be what you are.                            
80	                                The Artful Escape may not have particularly deep or challenging gameplay, but the main reason to attend this show is its incredible writing and Francis’ trippy, out-of-this-world journey in discovering his new persona, one which features a lot of nifty twists in various ways, alongside truly striking sci-fi visuals and an expertly-crafted soundtrack. The Artful Escape is an astonishing rock and roll epic that the likes of Ziggy Stardust would be proud of.                            
80	                                A tour de force of light and sound, The Artful Escape is unlike anything else you’ve played. With no easy genre label to stick on the game, the only way you’ll know if you’re going to enjoy it is to try it. It’s a trip alright, one that will have your foot tapping and your head rocking from start to finish.                            
80	                                It's also worth mentioning there are some substantial performance issues. The frame rate dropped considerably fairly often, pulling us out of its gorgeous world. There were also a few occasions where dialogue on the screen was not voiced, which felt very odd. However, these issues aside, The Artful Escape is absolutely an adventure worth taking. It contains some magical moments, an engaging narrative and the best soundtrack in a game all year. It doesn't always hit the mark, but when it does, it smashes it out of the park.                            
80	                                A cosmic rock voyage of self-discovery that doesn't folk about, The Artful Escape is a truly unique experience and a feast for the senses. Those looking for a challenge or who are deathly allergic to guitars will probably want to look elsewhere for their next game. But given what an unusual and aesthetically captivating experience it is — and the fact that it's right there on Game Pass — it couldn't be easier for me to recommend. It'll likely prove a little too strange for some people's tastes, but if you don't enjoy it, it's still a quick (and hopefully at least interesting) 1,000G boost in five hours or so from a game you likely won't remember playing this time next year. But if you do end up enjoying it, and I think a lot of folks will, there's a very real chance it could end up being five hours you'll never forget.                            
80	                                Though it's a relatively short and easy game, The Artful Escape is also a charming, witty spectacle from start to finish in its six or so hours of playtime. I loved Francis' story and the far-away lands he visits on his quest to believe in himself and write his own future. I can foresee some players scoffing at the entire project for its particular brand of humor, but expect it will be adored by drama kids, garage rockers, and general outcasts all over. The Artful Escape plays like a psychedelic jam band session and tells a story like someone spiked Wes Anderson's Darjeeling tea.                            
75	                                The Artful Escape is a great visual-novel and a rock and roll dream. It is one of the best looking games I’ve played with an equally interesting narrative. However, the severe lack of interactiveness really drags down the game.                            
75	                                Highly contemplative, utterly eccentric and absolutely magnificent, The Artful Escape offers a visual and sound experience that is as puzzling as it is thrilling. But the beauty of the abstract can reach its limits when the nonsense ends up losing us. And the journey sometimes runs out of steam when the gameplay remains on its way. However, the journey remains relatively captivating up and down, both for its beauty and its uniqueness. But there is no doubt that it will be divisive.                             
74	                                The Artful Escape is a joyous intergalactic trip with an electric guitar and vibrant visuals. Like a good solo, if you get swept up in the experience, you'll forget all about its flaws.                            
70	                                For players who find themselves similarly unsure of their own identities, it could well resonate long after the amps and stage lights have been switched off. [Issue#364, p.116]                            
70	                                The Artful Escape is a wonderful four-hour musical performance with some epic guitar solos and an incredible visuals.                            
70	                                The Artful Escape feels like a novel written by a musician, and takes the music and electric guitar fans to a beautiful but not so perfect journey.                            
50	                                The lack of challenge in The Artful Escape, not just in its play but in its emotional texture, somewhat shreds the odyssey.                            
90	                                Fatal Frame: Maiden of Black Water is a uniquely thrilling horror experience. Armed with only a camera and your wits, the tension is palpable and oozes out of every nook and cranny of Mt. Hikami and the surrounding areas. The camera serves to be as trusty of a weapon as a gun and adds a distinct tension to the action that few games could replicate. The atmosphere, level design, and story all work in tandem to create a surprisingly tense and beautiful experience, despite relying a bit too much on backtracking and having a rather thin story.                            
80	                                Fatal Frame: Maiden of Black Water is a welcome return of an obscure, yet memorable PS2-era series. This revamp of the Wii U version still feels firmly rooted in the past, but it makes such superb use of atmospheric visual and audio effects that the overall experience is a unique take on horror games. It’s well worth giving this remake a second chance.                            
80	                                While there are several better titles in the Fatal Frame series, Maiden of Black Water has aged surprisingly well and can still deliver great fun.                            
80	                                Project Zero: Maiden of Black Water (Fatal Frame: Maiden of Black Water) just pulls you in and then never lets go. And it really works through great atmosphere, powerful sound design, stylish artwork, interesting plot and an interesting combat.                            
80	                                FATAL FRAME: Maiden of Black Water blends its haunting world with rewarding gameplay to craft one outstanding horror experience.                            
80	                                Project Zero: Maiden of Black Water is a refreshingly traditional survival horror game that's genuinely scary.                            
80	                                Despite a few annoyances, Fatal Frame: Maiden of Black Water is a fantastic horror adventure that is releasing at the perfect time on consoles and PC. If you've been looking for a new game to play over Halloween, Fatal Frame: Maiden of Black Water is absolutely worth getting on PS5.                            
76	                                Fatal Frame: Maiden of Black Water is still an intriguing survival horror experience with creepy atmosphere and engaging story, but younger audiences may not like its old-style controls and slow pace.                            
75	                                I can’t say I enjoyed my time with Fatal Frame: Maiden of Blackwater, because I spent most of my time with the game paused, my hands over my eyes and the television on mute to drown out the creepy ambiance and the anguished cries of spirits trying to kill me.                            
75	                                A second chance if you missed the original. Not the best entry in the series, but still an enjoyable game for survival horror fans.                            
75	                                Fatal Frame: Maiden of Black Water is a genuinely unique horror game with all the fixings for a campy and spooky gameplay experience. Like any horror movie, you'll be asking, "Why are you going in there!?" but it's all part of the show. The remastered efforts shine, even if the narrative isn't winning any awards. If anything, this game teaches you that only good-looking people can be ghost hunters.                            
74	                                It keeps the charm of the franchise while offering some interesting moments, but it can't hide the fact that graphics and some gameplay elements are outdated. If you are looking for a plain and simple survival horror experience, you will probable be satisfied with this one.                            
70	                                Aside from the visual upgrade, Fatal Frame: Maiden of Black Water is far from a suitable remaster as it fails to change many of the original issues. However, while it's also far from the best Fatal Frame game, it does still offer players the signature enjoyable camera combat and some surprisingly spooky aesthetic.                            
70	                                I’m a little sad about how Maiden of Black Water resulted in Project Zero’s pause as a series. Great photography gameplay is on offer and had me frantically thinking on the fly to snap some solid (and horrific) photos. Poor pacing, voice acting and less than admirable treatment of female characters is present though, which can at times be tough obstacles to overcome. Still, the eerie atmosphere the game sets up for itself remains throughout. It is a thrilling, quite pleasurable experience that, while the answers may not always be satisfying, will leave you guessing until its conclusion. I can only hope this remaster is the start of a new turn for the series. Flaws and all, the Project Zero franchise is more than worthy of another shot in the spooky spotlight.                            
70	                                Project Zero: Maiden of Black Water is back. That's good news, and while it's not the best in the series, I've enjoyed it like crazy. It still retains the authenticity of the franchise, which makes it a more than valid option for anyone who wants to approach a slightly different survival horror that has a unique approach, but at the same time tastes like a classic.                            
70	                                The last Fatal Frame is still a quite enjoyable and creepy horror experience with great atmosphere, good length and engaging (yet convoluted) story, but its rusty control scheme and slow pace could keep the younger audience far away.                            
70	                                Fatal Frame: Maiden of Black Water does some things well and misses the mark on others. It generates tension well, but it depends too much on the simplistic, yet rewarding camera-based combat. Either way, Maiden of Black Water offers something compelling for horror fans to dig into, as long as you can accept its shortcomings.                             
69	                                Koei Tecmo with Project Zero: Maiden of Black Water, fixes the bare minimum to please the fans, giving us a game far too backward and slow to take root on a new audience.                            
68	                                Project Zero: Maiden of Black Water celebrates twenty years of Fatal Frame by remastering a game that felt already dated back in 2015 but still delivers an intense atmosphere.                            
65	                                Ultimately, the revival of Maiden of Black Water on modern hardware is a welcome operation but which is partly a wasted opportunity. The remaster will allow fans of the genre to rediscover an interesting experiment among survival horror, but greater care in realization would have made the last episode of Project Zero usable by a much wider audience. Despite the years that have passed since the first release and the absence of the technical limits imposed by exclusivity on Wii U, no additional effort has been made to improve a title with not properly refined mechanics. If over the years the Project Zero series has struggled to renew itself and has gradually crystallized into an aging playful formula, this new edition does nothing to remove Maiden of Black Water from the ancient spectrum of its roots.                             
60	                                Those who love the genre and will be able to forgive its many pitfalls.                            
60	                                Project Zero: Maiden of Black Water stumbles a bit in fully capitalising on the enhanced edition concept, yet it’s saved by a unique central hook that keeps the fright rate high and by the set of chilling environments to explore. Both of these elements were present in the 2014 original, but now can at least be enjoyed by a wider crowd.                            
60	                                The haunting atmosphere of Project Zero: Maiden of Black Water means that it’s definitely worth a play for horror fans on the whole. It’s just a shame that more hasn’t been done to improve its gameplay over the original Wii U version. Combat is fun for the most part, and also rather spooky. But during the many bouts of exploration in between, you’ll become frustrated due to the clunky controls that make moving the trio of characters involved quite simply a pain.                            
60	                                The storytelling and unravelling mysteries at the heart of this game is the elixir that keeps the camera rolling in its neat runtime, but the clumsy basic controls and mundane filler scenes hold the survival horror back from truly being a horrific work of art.                            
50	                                Project Zero: Maiden of Black Water is a different beast to the original games from a few generations ago which isn't necessarily a bad thing but the repetitive locations and enemies combined with the dragged out levels turn what could have been a spooky adventure into a tedious one.                            
50	                                If you liked the original, then this mesmeric remake is gorgeous and suspenseful, and I imagine it’s ideal after the Fatal Frame series has lain dormant for so long. On the other hand, if your palette for horror has been spoiled with more modern hits in the genre, Maiden of Black Water’s atmosphere rises to the surface while its other dated aspects pull it back down                            
50	                                You could do a lot better than Fatal Frame: Maiden of Black Water this Halloween season; the PS5 has built up its horror library up just enough for there to be something else worthy of your time. Those cutscenes, though. Very creepy.                            
50	                                While this remaster has its share of Kodak moments, unfortunately, the negatives are simply too much to ignore. With Fatal Frame: Maiden of Black Water’s disposable cast of characters and underdeveloped episodes that start to blur together like like an old Polaroid, survival horror fans are better off turning their focus elsewhere to get their fix this Halloween.                             
40	                                It’s unfortunate that Koei Temco has no intention of remaking or remastering the Fatal Frame series from the beginning. This slightly upscaled and modified port from Nintendo Wii U to current gen platforms puts forth a subpar experience that doesn’t sell me on the series. It seemed to just be the most convenient installment to make available for the 20th anniversary and it shows. If you’re like me and Maiden of Black Water is your first Fatal Frame game, I recommend you keep those expectations low.                            
40	                                Six years later, in that timeframe, Capcom did the opposite with Resident Evil 7 — which has now sold over 10 million copies, making it one of the most popular games in the franchise. I think if Koei Tecmo still has an interest in reviving the Fatal Frame franchise, they need to go back to the drawing board or give newcomers a good collection of games that made this survival horror series great in the first place.                            
30	                                An unasked for remaster of a tedious, badly written survival horror that is even less effective now than it was seven years ago.                            
96	                                The Dark Pictures games so far have set high bars in terms of story and production quality, and House of Ashes easily hits and even occasionally surpasses them. While I wasn’t so keen initially on one aspect of the tale, it turned around completely on a second play, but even to begin with it was nowhere near enough to ruin what is a fantastically acted and put together story, wrapped up in some of the most stunning audio visual work to date. Horror games are hardly in short supply, but very few reach this level of brilliance.                            
80	                                Despite the slow nature of the first half of House of Ashes, when it gets into its stride it is a homage to classic science-fiction action horror titles that will leave you on the edge of your seat. The scares may not be as obtrusive as the previous titles in the anthology, but this may then appeal to those that aren’t necessarily horror fanatics.                            
80	                                House of Ashes is a great interactive adventure and offers a fantastic story, with a great dose of terror and claustrophobia, and also action and some of the best conflicts between characters in the entire anthology.                            
80	                                There’s an immediate familiarity for House of Ashes in the Dark Pictures catalog, but this entry is as thematically complex and consequently engaging as any game in the series so far.                            
78	                                House of Ashes is the third game of the anthology, a very cinematic game where we see a clear evolution in the decisions and improvements in the QTE. But the control of characters and their factions continues to fail.                            
77	                                House of Ashes is the best game of The Dark Pictures Anthology due to its interesting history and its excellent artistic and design section, all this despite some problems that are already a constant in the saga.                             
75	                                At the end of the day, I still enjoyed my time with House of Ashes. It is the best story so far in the series and even with the issues I had with both the glitches and gameplay, this was a decent time overall. If you have played the series this far, you know what you’re getting into. If you want to give this one a shot to see what The Dark Pictures is all about, you can’t be this one’s story and premise. Just keep in mind, there will be some really strange bugs that come along with it.                            
75	                                House of Ashes does not distort the philosophy of Supermassive Games. While retaining the cinematic staging of The Dark Pictures saga, this third episode now offers a 360 ° camera and better integrated QTEs. Thanks to its controlled rhythm, its claustrophobic atmosphere and its interesting plot, it surpasses its predecessors despite its flaws (uneven writing, cartoonish characters, frozen shooting phases…). For anyone who enjoys interactive experiences of the genre, this latest iteration of the anthology is worthy of curiosity.                             
70	                                In all, House of Ashes feels marginally better than Little Hope, which I felt was certainly better than Man of Medan. That means The Dark Pictures entries are, by my measure, on an upward trajectory, and I sincerely hope Supermassive is able to make more of them. While I don't think this series has achieved its full potential yet, I think it's just one really great script away from achieving that. As a game, The Dark Pictures is in a great place now. As a script, this third entry in the series goes for The Descent and winds up only decent.                            
70	                                Although it may lack the over-the-top thrills of previous entries, House of Ashes is perhaps the best entry in The Dark Pictures Anthology to date. The cast of characters is strong across the board, and the story boasts a satisfying conclusion previous titles struggled to provide.                             
55	                                The Dark Pictures Anthology: House of Ashes is a fun enough way to pass a few hours, and is a lot more enjoyable when you get a few friends involved. But as a cinematic story, it's far too forgettable, with writing that's never better than 'fine' with performances to match.                            
50	                                The Dark Pictures: House of Ashes is unfortunately a step backwards compared to the previous episodes of the series, at least in terms of the script, atmosphere and technical realization. The affordable price makes it interesting for those who don't want to miss a single chapter of the anthology, but others should turn to the previous chapters or wait for a possible fourth episode capable of bringing the horror series back on the right tracks.                            
100	                                Yes, Banana Mania is essentially just the kind of Super Monkey Ball game that you'd expect. I just didn't realize how much I've missed this series. The single player levels present a challenging and creative experience, while the minigame offerings make this collection essential to anyone who likes to play local multiplayer.                            
90	                                Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania is a confident and addictive reminder of why Monkey Ball was so popular back in the day. It truly feels like a celebration of the franchise that’s jam-packed with content, bonuses, and unlocks. Monkey Ball still holds up with addictive challenge, fantastic music and a goofy, yet endearing premise, and all of it is accentuated by small yet meaningful additions that makes it more accessible than ever before.                            
90	                                Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania is a loving recreation and just pure, uncomplicated FUN.                            
90	                                As a fan of Super Monkey Ball since 2001, I found myself really happy with Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania. The package captures the fun and challenge of the first two games, while also including new content that makes it feel fresh. Banana Mania also offers a ton of content for its price point, and players are guaranteed to find something to love. Sometimes the difficulty level can get frustrating, and the Party Games could use some new options, but the game offers so much good, it's hard to complain. Whether you're a newcomer to the series or a fan from the beginning like me, I can't recommend this one enough.                            
85	                                It is glorious. Maybe not perfect, but still very good. It has everything I loved from Banana Blitz HD, and little of what I didn't. I highly recommend checking it out if you're new to the series, or if you just want to see a Dreamcast in a ball. [Issue #56 – November/December 2021, p. 71]                            
85	                                Super Monkey Ball: Banana Mania marks a return to form for the series, even if I am left hoping that we receive some substantial content updates in the near future to fill in gaps left from the originals. Fans who need an exact recreation of the originals or require challenge mode multiplayer might want to skip this one or wait for a deep discount, but those who just want to play Super Monkey Ball 1 and 2 again or the first time should absolutely pick this one up on Switch, especially if you enjoy playing on the go. While there is still a bit of work to do, Super Monkey Ball is back, and it’s a great feeling. I strongly recommend you don’t miss out on this one.                            
85	                                Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania is a fantastic addition to the Switch's library and one of the best party games on the system. While it has a few technical issues holding it back, it is still well worth your time.                            
83	                                Banana Mania is the best celebration for the 20th anniversary of the Super Monkey Ball series. It is full of fun with a lot of levels and minigames that any nostalgic fan would enjoy. Also, it's a celebration of SEGA with a lot of guest characters like Sonic, Tails, Beat, Kiryu Kazuma and Morgana from Persona 5.                             
80	                                Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania is a blast for veterans and newcomers, featuring plenty of appealing content, though I was slightly split on multiplayer. But with so much sheer monkey madness and unbridled fun, I’m very glad SEGA didn’t drop the ball.                            
80	                                After years of mediocrity for AiAi and the crew, there was always the worry SEGA might drop the ball when it came to a Super Monkey Ball 20th anniversary celebration. Thankfully, Super Monkey Ball: Banana Mania is a great remaster of the series’ best years packed full of content and given a handsome facelift. The major downgrade of the much-loved Monkey Target aside, there’s still plenty of fun to be had here fan or newcomer.                            
80	                                Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania retains the core appeal of the series: cute ball-encased monkeys rolling around devilishly challenging stages at high speeds. It ventures just far enough from the specifics of the original games to be considered a truly faithful remake, but those who aren’t intimately familiar with those games or are willing to adapt will find an amazing wealth of aggravating appeal and ridiculous stunts. It’s a great place to get acquainted with the series if you haven’t before, with plenty to offer veterans looking for something closer to the mark than the likes of Banana Blitz.                            
80	                                The newest Super Monkey Ball game isn't lacking for much. With a ton of remastered levels, modes, minigames, and unlockable prizes, this enormous package could keep a fan busy for the rest of their life - if they don't mind high blood pressure. The only thing more pervasive than the mountain of content is the franchise's usual blistering difficulty. Fun, frustrating, and rewarding, this is a great collection.                            
80	                                Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania combines 300 stages from Super Monkey Ball, Super Monkey Ball 2, and Super Monkey Ball Deluxe into a single, massive package of entertaining and occasionally sadistic ball-rolling action.                            
80	                                This is not the straight port or remake of the original GameCube Monkey Ball I might have asked for, but it’s a great game in its own right that brings to light a lot of what I loved about those earlier entries in the franchise. This is a lively, amusing video game that is stuffed with challenging marble-rolling stages, good-natured multiplayer games, and a lot of charm.                            
80	                                Bar none, Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania is my favourite arcade game on the Switch so far. The game’s short burst levels, no matter how challenging or luck-based they may be, lend themselves so well on a portable console. Rya Ga Gotoku Studios have done incredibly well in recreating and returning the niche love their arcade series has brought over the years. With plenty of playtime, cute characters to play around with, minigames to battle your friends in and challenging missions to overcome, Banana Mania can be everything you’ve ever needed in an arcade game on the Switch. It’s worth going ape over, folks.                            
80	                                Anyone who has played these Monkey Ball titles before will be satisfied with this new available version. Those who have never touched the series before and are looking for a challenging physics-based platforming adventure should try out Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania.                            
80	                                Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania is a bumper remaster package that has clearly been made with love by Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio. It contains all of the best levels from the series’ most beloved entries, a fleshed-out ranking system for the most ambitious players and a dozen party games to extend its lifespan. With cute crossover characters, rewarding puzzles and an absolutely banging soundtrack, you’d be foolish to skip this one if you’re yet to engage with the Super Monkey Ball franchise.                            
80	                                Super Monkey Ball: Banana Mania is an excellent time with bags of replay value, potential in its online leaderboards and competitive play, and works a treat in local co-op thanks to the fun, if sometimes superficial minigames.                            
80	                                Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania is a solid celebration for the 20th anniversary of the series’ inception. It caters to fans who have stuck around to see the next big thing and does so in a complete package with new surprises and things to come.                            
80	                                Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania is the best attempt yet by Sega to get back to the brilliance that was the original games. While purists will still feel just a little off at the game's physics, everyone else probably won't notice. With the stack of party games, things to unlock and almost near infinite replayability, Banana Manaia will be something you return to repeatedly. We've all been begging for a remake of Super Monkey Ball. We've finally got, and while it's not perfect – really what is?                            
80	                                Difficulty spikes and a wonky camera will occasionally have players throwing their controllers across the room. Still, this otherwise compelling remastered package demonstrates why Sega needs to make Super Monkey Ball one of its premier franchises.                            
75	                                It’s upbeat puzzle-platforming fun at its most deceptively chaotic, and while some aspects of it still feel stuck in the past, there’s also lots here to remind people of what made it so great in the first place.                             
75	                                Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania is just as fun and infuriating as I remember. It’s a content-complete package that celebrates the series. It can feel a bit too limited, with no online play or unlockable characters in minigames, but it’s still a unique experience you can’t get anywhere else.                            
70	                                Banana Mania takes the best Super Monkey Ball games and combines them into one solid package. Frustrations from those original games remain, and the lack of online play is a disappointment, but new options allow for a less stressful time.                            
70	                                Ultimately Banana Mania is a lot of fun, and a solid starting point to those new to the series. Long term fans might find the changes to accommodate a wider audience just too bitter a pill to swallow though.                             
70	                                The best of Monkey Ball, for nostalgics and newcomers. Banana mania doesn't betray its old school gameplay, and makes it more accessible to everyone.                            
70	                                Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania is a good game on which you can have fun and spend good moments. Whether you are a new player or an old player of the license, you will find what you need. However, you will have to be patient to get through some stages. With this opus, Sega invites players to rediscover their first love of the series by offering levels from the first Super Monkey Ball. As a bonus, the addition of mini-games is a plus to have fun with your friends during parties even if some mini-games are not necessarily the most exciting. As for the small drawbacks, we regret the fact that you can't play all the characters in all the modes or the difficulty which is not always progressive.                            
70	                                It may not be saying much but Super Monkey Ball: Banana Mania is the best the series has been in almost two decades and newcomers are bound to find a lot to love. It wears its heart on its sleeve and clearly the team has true passion for the franchise. It's packed full of content, new ways to play and there are so many extras and improvements that never existed in the original. Unfortunately, the engine beneath it all isn't quite up to the job. What they've achieved with Unity simply isn't on par with the originals and while the main game is still enjoyable, many of the party games are severely hindered. Until Monkey Target returns to its former glory, we cannot truly say Super Monkey Ball is back.                            
60	                                Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania is a competent and well-done remaster of the first three Monkey Ball console games. There are issues with how engaging those games can be, mostly due to the nature of the franchise's arcade style, so there are caveats about replayability. That said, Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania makes up for that repetitiveness by including as many modes and as much variety as possible outside of its core gameplay loop, which gives both new and returning fans something to look forward to, especially thanks to the multiplayer party games from Super Monkey Ball Deluxe.                            
60	                                Super Monkey Ball: Banana Mania should include everything fans love about the series: Skill-based difficulty, great music, fun minigames, and excellent replayability with a good group of buddies by your side. Unfortunately, this collection feels like a rushed remake that throws out the precise controls and stellar music of the original titles. The charm and fun gameplay of the original games are still there, but this remake doesn’t feel like much of an improvement over the classics.                            
50	                                I'm all for retro compilations giving players the option of making games more accessible, so players can set their own experience. Rewind features in old arcade shooters and platformers are great. But imagine if a retro re-release of Castlevania (or whatever) made it impossible to fall down a gap or get killed by a boss by automatically rewinding the mistake. Now imagine they gave players no way of turning that off? To deny people an inherent, defining quality of a game in favour of something that fundamentally changes the experience, without completely redesigning the game so that the new experience makes sense... Nah, it hurts this to say because I love Monkey Ball, but this is all terribe decision-making by everyone involved.                            
50	                                Another sub-par remaster of Super Monkey Ball that ruins the precision and elegance of the originals and replaces it with janky, unpredictable controls and shoddy presentation.                            
90	                                Ni No Kuni II: Revenant Kingdom The Prince’s Edition is a complete package for any JRPG fan. The world is fleshed out, its genuine joy to experience, the characters are interesting but Ni No Kuni II’s biggest strength is the gameplay. It constantly keeps on giving, but it never overwhelms.                            
90	                                Ni No Kuni II has big changes compared to its predecessor, and your love for it will depend on what you prefer: Action RPG or turn-based battles with mechanics that refer to Pokémon.                            
90	                                There’s little else like Ni No Kuni 2. It might not match the original’s sense of wonder, but there’s an inescapable warmth and charm in Level-5’s sequel wrapped up in a serious fantasy tale. With its improved approach to worldbuilding and combat, this is one Switch RPG not to miss.                            
90	                                Ni No Kuni 2: Revenant Kingdom is an excellent action-RPG that's arrived on Switch in a fantastic, feature-packed port. Evan and Roland's antics across this game's sprawling world are stuffed full of great characters, exciting combat and adventuring and a kingdom building mechanic that's a delight to get to grips with. It looks and sounds every bit as good as its predecessor and, although the story might be a little more hit-and-miss here, we were completely hooked into this one from beginning to end. This is a sumptuously crafted adventure you won't regret diving into.                            
89	                                Playing Ni No Kuni is like having an active role in an anime. The superb presentation and the wonderful humour are welcoming so that you can easily lose hours in its fantasy world. The game offers a rarely seen variety of gameplay mechanics and delivers where it should. The Switch Version lacks better graphics, but offers individual difficulty levels.                            
89	                                We love the art, the story, music and characters in Ni No Kuni II. It is a great J-RPG (which includes the three DLC previously released for PS4 and PC). The game runs at 30 FPS, with some drops, and resolution is also "downgraded" from the original.                            
88	                                The DLC is excellent, and the portability is aces. If you’ve never played Ni No Kuni II: Revenant Kingdom before, then the Switch’s Prince’s Edition is a must play for any JRPG fan. My only complaints are about what the game doesn’t have. Everything it does have is wonderful. It’s kind of worth it for the strange intro alone.                            
88	                                With a lighthearted, yet impactful narrative, a beautiful soundtrack, deep combat and kingdom building mechanics, and a delightful cast of characters, Ni No Kuni II: Revenant Kingdom - Prince’s Edition should be enjoyed for any JRPG fans.                            
85	                                The plot and scenario kept me engaged even in its tedium, and while the game is different from the stellar original, it is brilliant in its own right. [Issue #56 – November/December 2021, p. 69]                            
85	                                Despite the few framerate dips and noticeable visual downgrade, Ni no Kuni II: Revenant Kingdom Prince's Edition is still a solid port of a great game that provides Switch owners a chance to experience the title to the fullest extent.                            
85	                                While not as pretty as it’s PS4 older brother, Ni No Kuni 2: Revenant Kingdom Prince’s Edition is a delightful experience all around. All the additional DLC is just a welcome bonus.                            
85	                                I have once again enjoyed my time with Ni No Kuni II but like never before, reminding me why I like video games and why I am not too tolerant of the games that come out nowadays. And all in an adaptation that works very well.                             
80	                                Ni no Kuni II: Revenant Kingdom - The Prince’s Edition is a great action RPG that, despite some shortcomings on Switch, is totally enjoyable and includes a large amount of content that will give us dozens of hours of entertainment.                            
80	                                Ni no Kuni II: Revenant Kingdom Prince's Edition still provides an engaging story with endearing characters and simplistic, fun combat despite including a few bugs.                            
80	                                Ni No Kuni II: Revenant Kingdom Prince’s Edition brings a great game with all its DLC content to Switch. Like every Switch port there are concessions to be made with this version. The graphic quality does take a noticeable hit, and while the DLC content isn’t incredible, it does help make up for the technical concessions. Ni No Kuni II: Revenant Kingdom is a great RPG and should be played be all fans of the genre. The main selling point for Prince’s Edition is the portability factor. But while the visuals and performance is better on other platforms, Ni No Kuni II performs well enough on the Switch where it’s a viable platform to experience this game.                            
80	                                Ni No Kuni II: Revenant Kingdom is an adventure with a whole lot to do, and a whole lot of ways to do it. I cherished exploring this bustling world, and experimenting with the stellar combat system provided hours of entertainment. I just wish the developers focused a bit more on the strong fundamentals, rather than creating countless systems for the player to digest. Nevertheless, Revenant Kingdom is an exceptional title deserving attention from fans of almost any genre.                            
80	                                Ni no Kuni 2: Revenant Kingdom Prince's Edition signals the first coming of the game on Nintendo’s hybrid console three years after its original release. It brings together all the magic, all the thrill of Evan and Roland’s adventure, and all the content that was released post launch, plus all the technical sacrifices and compromises that should be expected on a weaker hardware. A must for those who haven’t played Ni no Kuni 2 before, and only wish to experience this on the go.                             
80	                                Ni No Kuni II is an adventure filled with charm, featuring accessible mechanics and fun side-activities. The Nintendo Switch version is by no means the definitive way to play, but this is a solid port worth investing in for both newcomers and fans alike.                            
80	                                Even with the expected adjustments to make the visuals fit on Switch, Ni no Kuni II still is a great RPG that you can now enjoy anywhere.                            
80	                                Ni No Kuni II: Revenant Kingdom – Prince’s Edition is a more than serviceable way for audiences that haven’t yet been able to play the game to do so. The game itself is very unique and a lot of fun, and with the included DLC there’s even more of it to enjoy. Those looking for the smoothest performance and best rendering will need to look elsewhere, but the convenience of a portable variant of Revenant Kingdom is an appealing one that won't be a barrier for those inclined to check it out.                            
80	                                Ni No Kuni II is a true tale, relating the initiation rite of young Evan who learns to become king. Voluntarily naive, he presents colorful characters in an often intoxicating artistic landscape, despite some errors in the course. Its marriage of genres, between J-RPG, management and STR, is a real success, with a mastered interdependence. Kingdom Mode alone can keep you entertained for hours! If the title of Level-5 was more inspired in terms of quests, and especially less easy, it could have really set the bar very high. There remains an experience that we recommend to you without fear.                             
80	                                Ni no Kuni II: Revenant Kingdom Prince's Edition is a good porting of an excellent JRPG with a compelling storyline. A good return.                            
78	                                Ni no Kuni II is a good game, rather on the easy side but blessed with a unique charm. This Switch version comes across as the least performant of the bunch, but the inclusion of DLC and portability are good reasons to consider it if you really don't have any other platforms to play on.                             
77	                                Although it has some technical problems, it is a game that I can easily recommend for players who want to experience Ni No Kuni II with slightly lower graphics, wherever they go.                            
77	                                Ni No Kuni II on Switch is a good port, but not the best possible. The art and style are still impressive, we can't say the same on the technical side, with drop in resolution and practically no anti-aliasing filter.                            
76	                                Ni no Kuni II: Revenant Kingdom Prince's Edition comes to Nintendo Switch with some sacrifices. Unfortunately, many charming details are not noticeable on this platform.                            
75	                                Surprisingly, Ni no Kuni II plays slightly better in handheld mode, but this is probably because it’s downscaled to 720p instead of trying to force 1080p resolution. Still, the stuttering is at best distracting during travel and at worst frustrating during technical boss fights. With that being said, the Prince’s Edition is not the best version of Ni no Kuni II, but it is the most portable. If mobility is key then consider picking it up on the Switch, but if visuals and performance are more important than a significantly better version of the game can be found cheaper elsewhere.                            
75	                                Despite the frenetic action combat system and the exquisite tactical component represented by the introduction of the cute Cioffi, already in 2018 Ni no Kuni 2: The Destiny of a Kingdom could not fully convince us, due to a cloying and excessively childish story , which among other things entrusted downloadable content with the fundamental task of answering the most interesting questions that remained pending. Including both the base game and its DLCs, the Switch version has at least partially remedied the "shortcomings" of the original version, the only pity that on the hybrid the product is affected by technical problems that are difficult to ignore. Ultimately, the future of the kingdom continues to look anything but rosy.                             
70	                                Thanks to its exquisite combat system, fun and involving game mechanics,and an absolutely stunning art style, this princely edition of Ni NoKuni II is a very competent conversion which earned its place on theNintendo Switch catalogue.                            
70	                                Ni No Kuni 2 offers a nice addictive adventure with varied and original features. However, its simplicity and its little scenario make it a nice title without being a monumental slap in the genre. Without a doubt, the porting to the Switch is successful and offers a portable version that is pleasant to take everywhere.                            
70	                                Ni no Kuni II: Revenant Kingdom is a very good action RPG with gorgeous visuals and a great soundtrack, but it is held back by unstable performance and visual cutbacks.                            
70	                                A strong but limited port on Switch for Ni No Kuni 2. This Prince Edition remains enjoyable and lovely, the license's universe feeling at home on Nintendo's console.                            
60	                                Ni No Kuni II looks incredible on Switch, but the price it pays in terms of poor performance is too high, resulting in an experience that you're better off having on any other platform.                            
50	                                It's good to see Ni no Kuni II follow its predecessor and make an appearance on the Nintendo Switch. Technically, however, this port is a mess. The framerate's all-over-the-place and the same can be said about the game's resolution. The gameplay's fine, but this title's shortcomings cannot be ignored.                            
95	                                Backed by a stunning art style and the voice of Geralt of Rivia, Tails of Iron is an excellent action-adventure RPG that offers a challenging yet satisfying Souls-inspired experience in a captivating medieval world.                            
90	                                Tails of Iron is a charming and often brutal Souls-like adventure, with some wonderful combat mechanics and a gorgeous hand-drawn world.                            
90	                                Tails of Iron is a fantastic, brutal, and gorgeous game. Placing rats at the forefront of an adventure game was a bold move, and serves the world that Odd Bug Studio has created immensely. The battle between the frogs and rats is intense, the combat is challenging - yet fair - and the wide variety of equipment is sure to make any RPG fan excited to experiment with new loadouts. I enjoyed every moment spent in the Rat Kingdom, and can only hope to see more from Redgi, his brothers, and this fantastic world.                            
90	                                Tails of Iron is an expertly crafted effort from Odd Bug Studio. The visual style alone is worth the price of admission, but the additional tough-but-fair combat, RPG-lite components and engaging exploration makes for a worthy entry into the Souls-like subgenre.                            
85	                                Tails of Iron borrows inspiration from other challenging games, but its beautifully crafted world and thought-provoking narrative definitely deserve your attention. Every new area offers more to explore and tests your skills to see this rodent’s adventure through until the end. Tails of Iron is an under-rat-ed gem that will make a mighty fine addition to your indie game collection this year despite some rare bugs and needed updates to the combat systems.                             
80	                                Tails of Iron is a good game, although it cannot actually fit into one certain genre. It is not very deep or complex, as developers rather focused on implementing well a few elements. Thankfully, the exploration and combat system work like a charm and turn this rat tale into one worth experiencing. Its 2D world is truly engaging, while the challenging combat offers plenty of satisfaction once it is mastered. Tails of Iron might not be an overly ambitious game, but it is entertaining and rewarding.                            
80	                                Tails of Iron isn’t the biggest adventure in the world – while it has numerous maps to explore, they’re not particularly expansive – but it does have a lot of heart. It’s easy to warm to Redgi despite him not having a voice, which is quite an achievement in itself, and as you travel around his kingdom, fighting off bugs, frogs and other pesky creatures, you’ll come to care about his fate. It’s the combat that’s the real star of the show here though, encouraging you to keep an eye on the various quest boards even when the tasks they offer only send you to the same few locations.                            
80	                                Odd inventory design niggles aside and shopworn concepts aside, Tails of Iron is beautifully presented and a roundly entertaining, surprisingly grim action RPG that boasts a grandly enjoyable combat system. Fans of punishing action RPGs and grimdark fairy-tales will find much to love here.                             
78	                                This is an enjoyable Souls-like that simplifies the formula but focuses on the right elements to make it work.                            
75	                                Even if Tails of Iron has some flaws, starting with its back and forth and its combat system that lacks evolution, the title is simply charming. Helped by its panoply of charismatic characters, its sumptuous visuals and its successful fights requiring precision and coordination, the creation of Odd Bug Studio offers a magnificent journey that we can only recommend ... at least, if the difficulty does not suit you. Don't be afraid.                             
75	                                With its tough-but-fair combat, timeless storybook visuals, and unique furry fantasy, Tails of Iron is one of the year’s most distinctive RPG experiences. The intentionally subdued pace and challenging nature will definitely test the impatient, but anyone looking for a knuckle-cracking slugger, powered by a tale of valor and vengeance, will find Odd Bug Studio’s sophomore effort washes down like a fine flask of Bug Juice. Rest well, Redgi, your friends have done your memory proud.                            
60	                                While it never totally fails to be an acceptable action RPG, most of Tails of Iron’s initial appeal doesn’t outlast its humdrum gameplay.                            
85	                                It's brilliant, challenging and an absolute joy to strategize with the cards randomly dealt to you. [Issue #55 – October 2021, p. 24]                            
80	                                If there’s an idea no one’s done before, it’s probably because it’s just a bad idea. But Zoink has managed to hit on something original that actually works with Lost in Random. Its audiovisual world-building is tremendous, ably lifting a servicable quest structure and story, and inventive combat plays to its strengths and is taken carefully up to the limits of its potential. However, the layers of interaction during battles make a promise of strategic complexity that isn’t kept, and encounters last too long without the depth to sustain interest. Nevertheless, everything is packaged beautifully and Lost in Random doesn’t outstay its welcome, either, leaving you craving one last roll of the dice.                            
80	                                Lost in Random isn't a terribly long game. Even if you do keep the battles long by maintaining normal difficulty you can knock it off in around a dozen hours or so of gameplay time. By that stage, you probably won't find the combat as charming as you did when you first started, but you'll still want to see it to its conclusion, because the narrative and humour are so particularly strong.                             
80	                                Lost in Random succeeds at telling a modern coming-of-age dark fairy tale that can be enjoyed by players of almost all ages, and the character and world design perfectly complements the zany and clever writing. The gameplay is likewise unique and engaging, and even though combat doesn’t offer extreme depth or challenge, it fits the scope of the adventure. However, the graphics and lighting suffer on Nintendo Switch, and if you have the ability to play it on another platform, you probably should.                            
80	                                Lost in Random enjoys an exquisite universe, between an artistic direction reminiscent of the golden age of stop motion and a particularly rich narration. Add to that combat mechanics cleverly built and well executed despite some redundancies and some under-exploited ideas. But in the end, Zoink offers us a fascinating macabre tale that never runs out of steam over time and is worth browsing.                             
75	                                Lost in Random definitely can hold its own against other titles and feels like a premium experience, but on it’s way there the balance between randomness and thought out design may have gotten a bit lost.                            
67	                                Everything looks blurry and unfocused, and the game makes use of the old “shroud everything in fog to hide shortcomings” trick that horror games used a few generations ago. Even worse, you can practically see the world falling apart, whether you’re looking from a distance (and you see gaps where buildings need to pop in) or up close (where the game’s assets don’t fully materialize). It’s bad, and there’s no way around that unfortunate fact. And it really is unfortunate, because, as I said, there are quite a few good elements to be found here. I’d even go so far as to say that if you can overlook how hideous it is, then Lost in Random is incredibly rewarding. But at the same time, there are some very real performance issues here, and if you don’t want to spend dozens of hours straining your eyes at ugly graphics, I certainly wouldn’t blame you.                            
90	                                Everything about this title is a joy and great, engaging gameplay is complimented by a beautiful world that springs to life on the PS5 both visually in its setting as well as its characters and stories. Top this off with a great protagonist and you have a game of the year contender in every respect. Metroid Dread? Who needs it.                            
90	                                F.I.S.T.: Forged In Shadow Torch is a gorgeous Metroidvania that tells a much better story than any anthropomorphic narrative has a right to tell. It's emotional and engaging during each scene brought together with challenging moments of action and puzzle-platforming. This game respects your time, but some moments can drag on due to limited fast travel and some confusing objectives. Who cares though, you're a rabbit with a robotic fist attached to your back; how cool is that!?                            
90	                                F.I.S.T.: Forged In Shadow Torch is an exceptional game. With innovative visuals that ooze charm and imagination, you will immediately fall in love with Torch City. The extensive combat system allows you to experiment with the mechanics to create some incredible combinations. Although the game is challenging, it never feels cheap, making you return to battles with new tactics and strategies. Perfectly paced and with plenty of surprises, TiGames has created something special that is a must for fans of the genre.                            
85	                                Torch City is really impressive. Every district has its own unique style and all the environments are extraordinarily detailed. The game’s atmosphere is fantastic, exploring the wonderfully designed world is very engaging and the combat system is great. Just go on and play it, unless you’re allergic to backtracking, because F.I.S.T. relies on it quite heavily. [11/2021, p.27]                            
85	                                A consistent, challenging and exciting dieselpunk Metroidvania in which a bunny smashes robots to pieces. What more could you want?                            
85	                                F.I.S.T. Forged in Shadow Torch features complex combat, a huge and incredibly detailed map to explore, loads of secrets to find, a lengthy campaign, and gorgeous visuals. While I may have had a few minor gripes and do wish there was less required backtracking, I had loads of fun chasing down The Legion and its Iron Dogs and unraveling the mystery of the spark. F.I.S.T. is a must play for fans of the metroidvania genre.                            
85	                                F.I.S.T .: Forged In Shadow Torch is a game that will delight metroidvania enthusiasts, while guaranteeing sufficient originality in the design to create its own identity.                            
85	                                While it may not redefine the Metroidvania style of games by any stretch of the imagination, F.I.S.T.: Forged in Shadow Torch is a stellar example of the genre done right. Featuring mildly interesting characters, a world teeming with life, and a well-designed map that is very player-friendly, it genuinely feels like it does damn near everything right. As long as you don’t mind an occasional table flip encounter here and there, this is a hare-raising adventure for the ages.                            
85	                                F.I.S.T. is a very solid metroidvania, with a neat universe and fights that keep you glued to the pad. Rather difficult and rich enough in content, TiGames' soft only suffers from a few clumsinesses, such as regularly misplaced checkpoints or a few lunar collisions, but nothing that can really spoil the pleasure of playing.                            
85	                                F.I.S.T. offers another fine example of an exploration-focused side-scroller, and fans of the genre will find plenty to love. What it lacks in innovation, it makes up for by executing familiar ideas at a high level and dropping them into an alluring world. Developer Bilibili has pulled a nice surprise out of its hat.                            
85	                                F.I.S.T: Forged in Shadow Torch's exciting, brutal combat, and rewarding exploration set it apart from many of its genre-mates, and make it utterly worth your time.                            
83	                                Maybe not the best metroidvania, but a strong contender. Great graphics, a lot of personality and fun, F.I.S.T. is one of those games that deserve your time if you like the genre.                            
80	                                Forged In Shadow Torch is a highly recommended adventure for fans of metroidvania style, with gorgeous graphics and art design and frenzied and forceful gameplay. Only some issues about control and difficulty keep it from excellence.                            
80	                                The level design in F.I.S.T. belongs to these excellent metroidvania games where there is just pure joy in exploration. The developer has great knowledge on what makes the genre tick, but at the same time they seem to be a bit “shy” when it comes to any form of innovative idea that would truly make them excel. Nevertheless, this is a must for fans of metroidvanias.                            
80	                                The odd gameplay issue aside, F.I.S.T.: Forged in Shadow Torch is one of the most enjoyable Metroidvanias you can play right now. While you probably won’t care about its story, it’s easy to fall in love with the game’s detailed world and somewhat cute characters. It’s the thrilling combat and raft of collectibles and upgrades to find that will have you going back to it time and time again, however, keen to make Rayton the powerful hero he’s destined to be.                            
80	                                If F.I.S.T. : Forged In Shadow Torch offers a relatively slow first part, thereafter, the Metroidvania is full of ideas and continues to renew itself. Its gameplay, at the beginning screwed to the ground, constantly gains in depth and becomes more and more aerial, and its universe, alive and coherent, offers varied and inspired landscapes. Between a jazz club, a remote village in snow-capped mountains and the streets of a retro-futuristic dieselpunk town, the title of TiGames is a constant invitation to travel. In other words, we warmly recommend F.I.S.T.: Forged In Shadow Torch which presents itself as the little surprise of this new school year.                             
80	                                F.I.S.T: Forged in Shadow Torch is an excellent offering that is surprisingly getting very little marketing at launch. With a great aesthetic, an engaging enough narrative, together with challenging combat and rewarding Metroidvania exploration, this is one resistance movement everyone should be signing on for.                            
80	                                F.I.S.T.: Forged in Shadow Torch is an exemplary action-adventure, packed full of heartfelt detail and design, daubed in a grimy-yet-absorbing aesthetic, and powered with punchy, satisfying combat. While some of its elements will be over-familiar to genre fans, the originalities still shine through, resulting in a brilliant-looking, great-playing metroidvania that will delight players, whether they have a fluffy tail or otherwise. Heed my words: It’s most definitely wabbit season.                            
80	                                F.I.S.T. Forged in Shadow Torch throws a lot of different things at the wall and tries to make them all stick. In the end, it's a bit of a messy mix of platforming, combat, robots, and animals that Dr. Robotnik would be proud of, but it's still great fun to play even if it doesn't make a lot of sense.                            
80	                                F.I.S.T.: Forged In Shadow Torch is a stellar Metroidvania adventure set in a beautifully realised world, replete with challenging combat encounters, rewarding exploration, and some spicy platforming action. Rayton Rabbit might be of diminutive stature, but he's punching well above his weight here in what is one of the best games of 2021 so far.                            
80	                                F.I.S.T. Forged in Shadow Torch is a must-buy for Metroidvania fans looking for something that tries new things. It takes the well-worn staples of the sub-genre and blends them with a steampunk feel and a richer storyline than most.                            
80	                                F.I.S.T.: Forged in Shadow is a very competent, very good-looking foray into the Metroidvania genre with solid platforming and exciting, demanding arcade combat. Torch City is a wonderfully-grim place to get lost in and it's rendered gorgeously, despite some awkward signposting at times. Most of all, it nails the sense of exploration and steady progress that's a hallmark of the genre and it does all of that with a kick-arse rabbit in a mech suit for a protagonist. If this is the level of quality that studios backed by the China Hero Project are going to deliver then the program has more than made a case for itself.                            
80	                                F.I.S.T.: Forged In Shadow Torch is a deftly crafted Metroidvania that while it doesn't do anything especially new or ground-breaking, nonetheless reframes the genre through a distinctly Chinese and attractive dieselpunk setting that fans of the genre and action adventures in general will assuredly enjoy.                            
78	                                With its interesting Dieselpunk world and gameplay that successfully reflects the characteristics of the genre, it is a game that Metroidvania lovers should not miss. Other players can also enjoy this interesting world, if they can ignore some little problems.                            
77	                                A metroidvania full of explorable areas, with a good combat system, but unable to stand out or say its very own.                            
75	                                While the boss fights can be frustrating, F.I.S.T. is a solid entry in the Metroidvania genre.  Anyone that enjoys these types of games should definitely experience what it has to offer.                            
75	                                Standing out among the Metroidvania crowd is tough, but with satisfying combat, great platforming and a cleverly designed and well thought out world, F.I.S.T. more than manages to stand on its own lucky feet.                            
73	                                F.I.S.T .: Forged in Shadow Torch is an imperfect production but by no means trivial: a metroidvania that does its own without excelling in any area, in any case denoting a certain expertise on the part of a team that is anything but accustomed to global stages. What is missing are only a bit of an overall vision, a sense of proportion (because the adventure is paradoxically even a thread too long) and a basic balance: sins of youth, however excusable, which cannot really affect the value of a title that can be played with a certain pleasure.                            
70	                                F.I.S.T. Forged in Shadow Torch is a remarkable game for such a young development team; however, it suffers from various balance problems, mitigated only in part by the introduction of an Easy Mode, as well as by a narrative rhythm that is not always at its best... but, without a doubt, it's an highly recommended purchase for alle the lovers of the metroidvania genre.                            
70	                                F.I.S.T.: Forged in Shadow Torch is one of the worst names for a game ever. Still the exploration is second-to-none. I wish the combat was more fluid or the enemy encounters tweaked a bit better. I feel like most people will quickly fall off once the difficulty ramps up. It is not hard due to challenge, but more because of functionality and that sucks. It tarnishes an otherwise incredible experience that could have easily been the next huge series in the genre. Still if you can muster through the challenge this is an experience worth taking.                            
70	                                F.I.S.T .: Forged In Shadow Torch combines a beautiful world full of anthropomorphic animals, stunning locations, great music, deep combos and fun exploration, but at the same time shows problems with uneven difficulty levels and unbalanced combat system.                            
70	                                FIST is a by-the-numbers Metroidvania, elevated by its cast of anthro characters and its deep and interesting dieselpunk world. However, this doesn’t distract enough to forgive its unbalanced combat, very standard level design and a lot of back-tracking.                            
70	                                Aside from rigid combat and some visual hiccups, F.I.S.T.: Forged in Shadow Torch delivers a unique world with an intriguing narrative and tight traversal.                            
70	                                With deep and challenging combat and tight controls, F.I.S.T. often provides a welcome challenge. That’s why it's such a shame that slow progression and poor design choices hold it back from reaching its full potential. Still, at its best, F.I.S.T. is a memorable Metroidvania with variety and depth. If you’re up for the challenge and willing to deal with these issues, there’s definitely a good time to be had.                            
80	                                For 10 bucks, you're getting a personality-driven rhythm romp with the hindsight of a decade plus of genre experience.                            
80	                                Of our protagonists, though, I'd want to be Ziggs. After all, he's here to light it up, set the world on fire, and break rules in two. After all, that's what the baddest do (sorry not sorry for being the best).                            
77	                                Curious League of Legends spin-off, this Hextech Mayhem. It’s a simple but solid rhythm game that could use some variety to spice up the gameplay and the level design.                            
70	                                Quotation forthcoming.                            
70	                                Impossible not to know League of Legends, especially in these days. Not that it's a bad thing, let's understand, and that's why we suggest you to play Hextech Mayhem.                            
70	                                New to the rhythm genre, Hextech Mayhem: A League of Legends Story should be a serious challenge for you. Scoring enthusiasts will find what they are looking for in this demanding experience which does not eat bread and which is readily enjoyed during short musical sessions. Too bad the excess information on the screen and the lack of ergonomics of the controls mar the experience. This last problem could nevertheless be quickly corrected by granting the possibility of modifying the commands.                             
60	                                A little platformer that lack a extensive OST, which is sad for a rhythmic game. Still, Hextech Mayhem is fun and a cheap way to extend the runeterra universe everyone is talking about now.                            
50	                                While Hextech Mayhem: A League of Legends Story provides a great experience in short bursts, none of its levels feel as replayable as the best of the developer's past work or the best of the rhythm genre. This is a fatal flaw in a game with gated progression, and there are no supplementary modes or other features to distract from it. As it stands, the game's mix of mobile mechanics makes its release on traditional platforms baffling, and only those who are immediately intrigued by Ziggs in a game outside of League of Legends will get something substantial out of the final product in its current available forms.                            
100	                                Sherlock Holmes Chapter One is gorgeous in graphics, with in-depth gameplay mechanics, and a deep, emotional story about mental health and trauma compile it into the masterpiece that it is.                            
90	                                Well-written dialogue and central plot, clever cases to be investigated, equally clever humorous touches balanced by some genuinely dark elements, extensive customization of the difficulty to prevent any notion of hand-holding, always coupled with the gorgeous isle of Cordona and touches of familiar Sherlock lore. Regardless of the genre one chooses to place it in, Sherlock Holmes Chapter One is a really good, perhaps even excellent game.                            
85	                                This is easily my favourite game of the year. I haven’t been this captivated by Holmes since I began reading the original works by Doyle.                            
85	                                Sherlock Holmes Chapter One is one of the very best series installments, thanks to a great story powered by solid writing, charming characters, varied cases, and new open-world gameplay mechanics that fit incredibly well. While some of these mechanics do require a little tweaking, such as combat, Chapter One is a very solid game that no fan of the series or adventure games should pass on.                            
83	                                In Chapter One we don't puzzle as intensely as in Crimes and Punishment,but we sink into Holmes' world more seamlessly than ever.                            
81	                                The PC version of Sherlock Holmes Chapter One avoids the frame drops and other glitches that some PS5 owners experienced with the console release, and gives us a fairly good detective game, with several culprits to find in a beautifully crafted turistic island. Fans of Sherlock Holmes might discover a quite different hero from the one they are accustomed to, but the overall experience of Chapter One is absolutely pleasant.                            
80	                                The doors of Sherlock’s decrepit, abandoned family manor unlock for him as he remembers more, slowly piecing together what happened to his mother. You can populate this place with paintings, furniture and possessions, filling out its character and history, a decent metaphor for your progress through the story and the game. This is a lively world, with wonderful smaller mysteries and an overarching story that brings you closer to its famous main character and his personal history. While there are some technical issues, and the game understandably lacks the glossy polish of bigger-budget titles, this is nonetheless something that I’ve been wanting for a long time: a properly open-world interactive detective story.                            
80	                                Despite some rough edges, Sherlock Holmes: Chapter One has its heart in the right place. Frogwares is taking the classic Sherlock mythos and spinning off some impressive original work here. The story is well-presented, with the partnership between Sherlock and Jon particularly pleasant. Other cases show some interesting new puzzle types that I have not yet seen before. Whilst the two strengths of this title are separate, which annoys me somewhat, it’s the annoyance I feel when a game is a few decisions short of me showering it in unqualified praise. As it stands, Sherlock Holmes: Chapter One is a standard-setter for open-world mystery games.                            
80	                                An island full of riveting mysteries, stuck with some truly awful and jarring combat.                            
80	                                With a strong narrative and exceptional investigation mechanics, Sherlock Holmes Chapter One manages to one-up its predecessors. Sadly, it also doesn't reach its full potential, though we can hope that future titles are more in-depth.                            
80	                                The strength of Frogwares previous works is retained within more ambitious, freeform packaging. Sherlock Holmes: Chapter One can be abrasive, both in gameplay terms and in its depiction of an iconic character, but it offers such rich and rewarding depth to its detective drama that it’s much easier to accept.                            
75	                                For its ambitious prequel, Frogwares relied on an open world that enjoys a rather generous scope for a wide range of surveys. These also give the game a very solid lifespan. On the other hand, the proposal proves difficult to measure up on a technical level, with slowdowns, rigid animations and clipping in support. More engaging in its second part, Sherlock Holmes: Chapter One offers progressive dynamism and a commendable conclusion. The heart of the adventure lies in its clues to be connected and the accusations to be made, which follow a pattern of investigation which, however, runs out of steam too quickly.                            
71	                                The shift of the series to an open world formula is a bit of a missed opportunity, but as a detective adventure Sherlock Holmes: Chapter One works well both in terms of writing and gameplay.                            
70	                                Sherlock Holmes: Chapter One is a very good detective game. It gives us the illusion of being a true master detective. The game world is a great alternative to London. Sadly, there’s one serious flaw: Chapter One is too easy with barely any real puzzles around. However, it’s still a must-have for any fan of Sherlock Holmes, if only to see how the young Holmes became the Detective we all love.                             
70	                                Frogwares tries to do a bit too much and there a some annoying bugs left, but this new entry in the franchise still offers some interesting innovations for the fans, and becomes a great entry to discover Sherlock Holmes' video game adventures.                            
70	                                On one hand, there are aspects that are brilliant and can fill you with great satisfaction when every piece of the puzzle falls into place. On the other hand, when the immersion is broken by obnoxious or random ways of finding the next clue, you’ll find your enjoyment of each case diminished.                             
65	                                Sherlock Holmes Chapter One satisfies the need for an immersive detective simulator but fails to provide a conclusive result that shows the truth behind some of its mysteries.                            
40	                                Sherlock Holmes Chapter One takes the series in a completely opposite direction of its predecessors, souring its potential in favor of adding gameplay elements that pad runtime and take away from the investigations. Fans of the series may find some joy in getting to experience the original content or solving clues the hard way, but I was certainly not one of them.                            
92	                                Unpacking is one of the best games of the year due to its brilliant idea: telling a person's life through their moves. Perfect in playability and sound, the story of Unpacking deserves to be lived.                             
90	                                Unpacking uses its simple, satisfying puzzle gameplay to tell a moving story about the things we take with us.                            
83	                                Unpacking has found a unique voice in how it has chosen to tell a story and for that deserves to be on everyone’s play list.                            
80	                                Unpacking transforms a tedious chore into a moving game. Moving someone's stuff makes that person come alive, even if you'll never meet her.                             
80	                                Unpacking is a puzzle game with fun and engaging narrative elements, exciting, capable of leaving much more than a videogame experience. A little surprise.                            
80	                                This is a small game, but its meaning and intent are large. Like any domestic drama, it tells us as much about our own lives, tastes and experiences as it does about the characters we are bonding with. One thing is certain: learning about the relationships this protagonist has with her possessions, her lovers and her family, and how they affect her, is one of the most profound and touching experiences I’ve ever had playing a video game.                            
80	                                Witch Beam fills with magic and originality a gameplay as simple as it is effective: open boxes, take objects and place them wherever possible. With a level structure that ends up being recursive, the game does not aim to surprise with its mechanics, but rather to serve as an open book adaptable to the tastes, preferences and even hobbies of each player. Bedroom, kitchen, bathroom... Memories, in short, that remain by our side despite the circumstances, despite the changes of residence that we have to make – even if some of them are against our will. Unpacking manages to make you participate in this complicated process of turning a house into a home. Visually beautiful, it is a clear example of the video game's unique capabilities.                             
80	                                Unpacking is real gem that deserves a wide audience. It is short, but the sheer love and care put into the entire game shines through at every turn and the careful balance achieved between freedom and restriction ensures satisfaction without frustration. Add in a wonderfully realised and intimate narrative that makes brilliant use of the values we place upon objects and you have an indie game that should find a place in your collection.                             
73	                                Unpacking is a relaxing and entertaining experience, that lasts long enough to still be fun by the end of it, and not become a chore in the process.                            
70	                                Unpacking is a very original title, and one that is a lot more than virtually unpacking boxes. The ebbs and flows of the story will make you want to see it through to the end, even when the lines between unpacking items and Unpacking (the game) start to blur.                            
70	                                As a game, Unpacking is limited to the simplest puzzle genre, without much difficulty. However, it is a storytelling wonder, accessible and very benevolent.                            
70	                                As someone who generally hates sorting things out and often leaves boxes out for weeks at a time, I can say that Unpacking is a much better experience than the real thing.                            
100	                                But, like I've said, those nifty puzzles are just the jumping-off point for what makes this such a remarkable, memorable experience. A clever game of unloading boxes would have been enough to make Unpacking worth playing, but it's the way it weaves its beautiful story through those puzzles that makes it truly sublime.                            
100	                                To make a process that is usually so mundane into something so magical makes Unpacking a must play.                            
95	                                I started Unpacking mostly expecting an interesting puzzle game about item placement and ended up with a story and protagonist I cared about. The art is beautiful, the world detailed, and the ambient sound of simple things, like a refrigerator running, put you in the world. Beyond minor woes, Unpacking does everything you’d want in a puzzle game and then some.                            
90	                                Unpacking manages to do several things very well, all at the same time. It’s a touching story told through interaction, it provides the creative play space of a great dollhouse game, and it deftly applies established game design ideas from completely different genres. Its only real shortcoming is the repetition that is a necessary byproduct of landing its message. Effort has gone into making the controls satisfying on Switch, and the visual and sound design are delightful throughout, making Unpacking, like any sane person’s cutlery, absolutely top-drawer.                            
90	                                When Animal Crossing: New Horizons released around the time people were going into lockdowns across the globe, a lot of people praised the way it helped people. Unpacking is exactly that for me right now with so many long games and deadlines. It has been a perfect game to dip into as a break from longer and more stressful games. While the gameplay might be too simple for some, Unpacking has managed to make something as mundane as arranging furniture and items be a lot of fun. It also helps that Unpacking on Nintendo Switch makes great use of the system’s features.                             
90	                                That's what makes Unpacking such a treat. I peered into the life of someone else and saw myself. It compelled me to look back on my own experiences, the good and the bad, through the simple act of unpacking the contents of their life. Unpacking may be a zen puzzle game that's just relaxing for some, but for me it was a more profound experience that I'll never forget. Sometimes we put our past into proverbial boxes; ripping off the tape and rediscovering what we hid away can be cathartic and illuminating.                            
80	                                If this review has sounded a little contemplative, it’s a testament to some clever design that invites you into that headspace. Arranging the protagonist’s collection of belongings is a subtle but thoughtful way of telling a person’s life story without saying a word, and the act of doing so, as well as how you choose to do it, might just end up saying a bit about yourself. Unpacking is a calming, enjoyable journey through time that is as satisfying as it is self-reflective. Much like every object you unpack, this game itself is simple and unassuming at face value. The sentimentality you choose to attach to it, however, is up to you.                            
65	                                Unpacking on Switch doesn’t quite stick the landing of the zen experience it aspires to be, but if you can tolerate some frustrating interfaces and controls, this is still a game worth exploring. Just maybe consider playing it on PC since that experience should be much stronger without the control caveats.                            
85	                                Quotation forthcoming.                            
80	                                Overall if you’ve played a Dark Picture Anthology game, you know what to expect with House of Ashes. They seem to all play around the same but have different stories and gameplay circumstances. Whether the story is good or not, or characters are interesting or boring is all left up to opinion for the most part. One thing is for sure though – if you’re a horror fan, you really need to get into this series, because it has some great stories to tell and some nice moments of horror to share. House of Ashes is my personal favorite of the Dark Pictures games so far and it definitely rivals Until Dawn. It’s hard to say it’s better than Until Dawn, because they both have their ups and downs, but it’s definitely a contender.                            
80	                                House of Ashes has its flaws, especially on a technical level, but it is clear that things happened since Man of Medan. More intriguing, richer and better staged than its predecessors, the third installment of the Dark Pictures Anthology easily manages to rise to the top. And we can say Supermassive Games is on the right track. We are already looking forward to discovering how they will manage to surprise us on the next episode.                             
80	                                It's the less terrifying game in the series, but it keeps you on your toes constantly. Its focus on camarederie and cooperating to survive works really well. Anyway, if you didn't like the previous entries, this one won't probably appeal you either.                            
78	                                Coming out just in time for Halloween, Dark Pictures Anthology: House of Ashes bring us again the great horror experience of this Bandai Namco and Supermassive’s series. This time, a platoon in the middle of the Iraq war has to face an ancient curse in the sumerian underworld. We have some new add-ons like a free camera and the option of choose the difficulty on the QTEs sections, plus the next gen graphic versions in 4K and with Ray Tracing, but more tension than scary moments and nothing new to keep the series fresh. Nevertheless, the great coop and funny multiplayer are back, and House of Ashes is a damn entertaining game.                            
75	                                House of Ashes offers an engaging story and does a wonderful job in creating a ghastly setting, leaving you in a world full of dark and frightening secrets. If you are a fan of survival horror genre, House of Ashes won't disappoint you.                            
75	                                House of Ashes is the best episode in the Dark Pictures Anthology so far. Some adjustments and additions add more depth to the experience, and while some cons from previous episodes persist, the overall quality of the experience is higher.                            
70	                                The Dark Pictures Anthology: House of Ashes has come to revolutionize the series with the gifts their predecessors gave them. Not only does it fill in the imperative requirements for a good horror game, it spreads the implicit message that it's only in reach of the bravest to conquer fear, in authentic tests of pressure and choices. In a scenario completely obscure, where you can see nothing but feel everything, the decisions must be made and the course of history changed... forever. House of Ashes is, without a doubt, the best game of the series so far.                            
70	                                Easily the best of the Dark Pictures Anthology series, which finally manages to serve up some interesting characters and effective horror scenes, with an appealingly gothic atmosphere.                            
70	                                The Dark Pictures Anthology still needs to iron out a few things before it can produce a truly classic entry, but thanks to a strong and fun story with a lot of twists, welcome difficulty options and stronger choice-based gameplay, House of Ashes shows the series is still striving to make notable improvements when it comes to crafting scary and entertaining tales.                            
60	                                If you enjoyed the first two games, there is some fun to be had in House of Ashes, but glitches, a predictable story structure and some boring jump scares holds it back from being a truly worthy sequel.                            
90	                                There is nothing quite like these unique games, especially when in top form like Banana Mania. Their prowess at granting addicting stages and a constant desire for self-improvement are borderline unmatched. Quite honestly, seeing this revival is legitimately miraculous. I implore fans and even those who are vaguely interested in getting this collection and giving it a shot to let Sega know that classic Monkey Ball still has a thriving, dedicated market.                            
87	                                Banana Mania delivers the best levels, mini-games and modes from the 20-years old Super Monkey Ball series... and it's more fun than ever.                            
85	                                Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania boasts a triumphant return for everyone’s favourite primate puzzler, bringing along with it potentially 100s of hours of gameplay that long-time fans and newcomers alike will easily go bananas for.                            
85	                                Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania is a superb package with tons of quality content and one of the best party games you can play today despite its flaws.                            
81	                                Combining the three best games in its series, Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania offers great value for very little. While the game certainly primarily seeks the attention of a younger audience, core gamers might also enjoy it due to precise controls and a neat challenge mode.                            
80	                                An excellent compilation of the first three Super Monkey Ball games, with lots of content. A truly enjoyable trip down memory lane, with fun gameplay that will keep you busy for a long time to come. There's some minor annoyances - you can't choose the worlds you visit in story mode, for example - but none that will genuinely hurt the experience.                             
80	                                Banana Mania simultaneously caters to younger players and old fans alike with a solid representation of the franchise’s most successful ideas and plenty to do.                            
80	                                After many failed outings, the Super Monkey Ball franchise is back. Bubbling with content, there’s plenty to do whether you want to play solo or multiplayer. Whilst the nature of the game can cause frustration, the removal of the lives system has helped to improve the experience. The infectious presentation combined with the lovely gameplay makes this an absolute joy and an essential purchase for fans of the series.                            
80	                                Despite the twenty years on the monkey shoulders, the first Super Monkey Balls remain puzzle video games of superfine quality, albeit tough on the verge of sacrilegious imprecation. Retrogaming aside, Banana Mania is undoubtedly the best way to experience its spinning gameplay recipe, now also open to welcoming any newbies thanks to the introduction of some optional "assist controls". The picture closes with a wealth of content that not many other remasters can boast, although part of the secondary offer, in terms of accessibility, is essentially for a select few. Stuff to spin the ... balls.                             
80	                                Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania was a pleasant surprise, in that it doesn’t mess too much with a formula that works and it makes strides to welcome newcomers into the fold. Not all of its stages are created equal, but this is a great entry point into a series that’s been lacking one on modern platforms for a long while.                            
80	                                It’s a shame that the camera works against you at times, and pretty much all of the content here may be recycled from previous games, but that doesn’t stop Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania from being outrageously entertaining. Also, while the game’s premise is simple, there’s a great level of challenge here that will keep players returning time and time again to master all of the stages on offer. Throw in the party games that each offer their own unique take on Monkey Ball action, and you have a package that’s not to be missed by those who simply like to have fun.                            
80	                                I’m confident that most fans will love Super Monkey Ball: Banana Mania. Though the challenging levels may be off-putting for some and no online multiplayer is disappointing, there’s a wonderful experience within that improves upon Banana Blitz HD’s flaws. RGG Studio’s done a fine job recreating these classic games into one comprehensive package and considering the lower price (£34.99), Banana Mania comes highly recommended.                            
80	                                Banana Mania doesn't reinvent the wheel (ball?), but it doesn't need to. Having the ability to play classic Super Monkey Ball levels and minigames without having to drag your old consoles and CRT TV out of storage would be enough of a selling point on its own, but the additional gameplay tweaks and charming extras sweeten the deal quite a bit. If you're a longtime roller who's missed AiAi and his jungle buddies--or if you're a newcomer looking for an easy-to-learn action/puzzle game that will keep you busy for a good while--you'll want to take Banana Mania for a spin.                            
80	                                Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania delivers a mostly delicious and nearly never-ending buffet of bananas and challenges to keep pretty much any player rolling for a good, long time.                            
80	                                Banana Blitz is a joyous celebration of what are still arguably the three best games in the series. There are a few slight performance issues and we have no doubt die-hards will argue about the overall feel, but there's a wealth of entertaining banana-hunting here regardless.                            
79	                                For Super Monkey Ball fans out there, this game is going to be fun because of the variety of creative mazes SEGA has in store for you. The modes beyond the main will be hit or miss depending on expectations. Nonetheless, Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania is mostly entertaining.                            
77	                                An ageless classic that returns in time for its twentieth anniversary. Always beautiful, always fun, but the years passed begin to take their toll.                            
75	                                Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania is essentially a good-looking remake of Super Monkey Ball Deluxe with some nifty extras which is cool because that's an excellent game to bring back. So, if you're itching to master tricky levels then this package is sure to scratch.                            
75	                                Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania is perfect for fans wanting to revisit what they grew up with on modern consoles. It’s also a great entry point for new fans. Some of the best levels and modes in Super Monkey Ball history are all in one place. Although some elements of the game have aged better than others and there are a few missteps there’s no denying that there’s a charm to the latest Super Monkey Ball. Even with its issues, Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania is a delight to play. It fills you with nostalgia whilst also showing the strengths of the series. It will be interesting to see where the franchise goes next.                            
70	                                Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania breathes new life into the franchise by combining classic stages with a modernised visual appearance. However, the remade physics don’t quite live up to the originals and this may put off purists. If you can get over the small niggles, then there is a ton of content to enjoy and newer players should have a blast as this is the most accessible Super Monkey Ball experience yet.                            
70	                                Celebrating the series 20th anniversary, Super Monkey Ball: Banana Mania is a hugely challenging trip through the greatest hits of the series, showing off classic courses rendered beautifully for the new systems. The Party Games remains the jewel in the Monkey Ball crown, but there’s more than enough to get your brain working whilst you’re balancing out a monkey in a ball on perilously thin ledges. It’s good to have Monkey Ball back.                             
70	                                With Monkey Ball, gameplay is king. And, as history has shown, really hard to get right! But Banana Mania does its best, and its best is honestly pretty okay.                            
70	                                Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania is a solid, unglamorous return to the series greatest moments. We’ve been steering monkeys in balls across increasingly difficult landscapes for 20 years now, and while Banana Mania doesn’t return the series to its hallowed position of old, I don’t want it to stop quite yet.                             
70	                                Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania is a vibrant celebration of the series' history that will test both your skills and your patience. But if you're up for the challenge, don't hesitate to add this to your PS5 library.                            
67	                                Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania is a present for fans of the series who are sadistic enough to find enjoyment in the constant failure, however SEGA has left training wheels to cultivate a new generation of fans. Perhaps in another 20 years someone else out there will recall their fond memories playing this series, whether alone or with friends. I just hope that this person will be able to play a version of Monkey Target that works.                            
60	                                After Banana Blitz HD deemed too simple by the majority of players, the Super Monkey Ball saga decides to go back to its beginnings to offer early fans what they expect: a level of difficulty. Unfortunately, even if the challenge is indeed present, Super Monkey Ball: Banana Mania disappoints. The 4K / 60fps combo available on next-gen is not enough to hide the many flaws of this remaster, starting with the camera which lacks flexibility and the general level-design which plays too much with chance. However, if you hang on to the formula, note that you get what you pay for. The content is more than generous, the replayability is strong and the store is a pleasant surprise that adds extra interest.                             
60	                                It all looks gorgeous, moves smoothly, and sounds exuberant as ever. We'd say that for Monkey Ball fanatics this is a bit of a must, but then said fanatics are the ones who will notice the cracks more than anyone else. So we're not sure, ultimately, who this is for. Newcomers may find themselves wondering what all the fuss is about.                            
60	                                Monkey Ball: Banana Mania has plenty to do, but not enough of it is half as fun as I remembered it. Its levels quickly become repetitive and frustrating, and the bright, cheerful environments and silly characters aren’t enough to combat the tedium of retrying aggravating levels. When you consider the various gameplay modes, difficulty levels, challenges, and unlockables, it could take dozens of hours before you see everything, though you’ll likely run out of momentum long before that point. It’s much more enjoyable as a local multiplayer party game, so stick to party mode — or skip it entirely.                            
65	                                In the end, I am a fan of where Weird Beluga aimed but not as much as where they landed. While the world that Clid resides in is full and realized, its characters unique, its level design excellent, and its overall tone unexpectedly great, the gameplay itself, not plague fuelled slugs, seems to be the biggest deterrent Clid needs to overcome. No matter how Weird Beluga wants to tackle this, whether it be leave it as it is or patch it, they still stand as very innovative and exciting developers. As for the gamer, if you think I’m just weak and you can do better managing the punishing level of gameplay, you should definitely pick this up. Otherwise, maybe see what they do moving forward before you dive into this strange and unique foray into gaming.                            
60	                                Showing promise in the early stages, Clid the Snail is both a charming shooter filled with a ton of character and visually interesting themes. However, the slow pace, cluttered worlds and repetitive gameplay fail to elevate the game to true greatness.                            
60	                                Quotation forthcoming.                            
60	                                A running and gunning snail is an unusual premise for an action-puzzle game, but it’s not as silly as it sounds. There are some moments of brilliance that raise it above your standard indie twin-stick shooter and it’s easy to get lost in the miniature world. The difficulty can be punishing, though, and without much by way of guidance, frustration sets in as the adventure often crawls to… a snail’s pace.                            
60	                                Clid The Snail is a charming indie game with characters that you can easily grow to love just by spending time with them, and a narrative that is entertaining and consistent all the way through till the end. However, its gameplay issues and the clash of two very different vibes pull you out of those fun moments constantly, and you're left reminded of all the game's shortcomings all over again.                            
60	                                There’s a lot to like about Clid the Snail. To say this is from a small team, the worldbuilding and ingenuity is second to none. But while ‘unforgiving’ may have been the developer’s intention, the game’s boss encounters are far too frustrating to be enjoyable. With a bit more balancing to Clid and his armoury, this will be a must-play twin-stick shooter. Until then, only those with patience as hard as Clid’s shell will be able to truly enjoy what’s on offer here.                            
60	                                Clid the Snail is a beautiful game with tons of personality and a world that begs to be explored, but the combat and gameplay is so frustrating that it makes doing so a huge a chore. The good news is that it only takes a patch or two to fix the weapon damage and rolling issues if they're viewed by many as a source of frustration rather than challenging, fair combat. While it's not the best experience right now, players should absolutely follow its post-launch development, because Clid the Snail oozes, like so many of its menagerie, with the kind of potential that could make it an excellent entry into its genre with some meaningful tweaks.                            
60	                                At the end of the day, Clid the Snail is a fun but flawed first effort for Weird Beluga. I enjoyed the game’s more deliberate approach to its gunplay, and the weapon variety and shell customization options kept the action feeling fresh. Add to that some excellent puzzles and fantastic worldbuilding, and there’s no denying that there’s a lot to love here. That’s why it’s such a shame that things become so frustrating due to the developer’s artistic choices. After all, it’s hard to focus on a firefight when it looks like half of the screen has been slathered in vaseline. Perhaps the developer will add a patch down the road to remedy the muddy visuals. And if they do, Clid the Snail will be a much more playable experience. As for me, I’d probably wait and see if they clean things up before taking the plunge. However, if those issues aren’t enough to dissuade you, escargot ahead and give Clid a shot.                            
55	                                After some digging, I found that the indie developers at Weird Beluga focused on three design pillars for Clid the Snail “methodical and challenging combat, exploration and puzzles, and an emphasis on narrative.” The team found success with two of these three pillars, the exploration in Clid is quite enjoyable. Made even more so by the absence of a radar like system, I rather enjoyed the very old school approach. Even the story in Clid the Snail hit all the notes of comedy, tragedy and action on queue. But that combat… they absolutely NAILED the challenging part. It’s just a shame that it isn’t much fun and instead just feels like an exercise in futility at parts.                            
55	                                Some technical difficulties on PlayStation 4 and huge difficulty spikes hinders a game with some good ideas and a wonderful setting.                            
50	                                A forgettable shooter.                            
85	                                Backed by breathtaking visuals and incredibly visceral combat that holds its own against some of the genre’s elite, Bright Memory: Infinite is a fun and bombastic jaunt for action fans to revel in.                            
80	                                A beautiful looking game with simple-yet-engaging sword and gunplay, it’s hard to think that this was made by one man. Yet Bright Memory: Infinite is proof of a passion project done right, even if it does suffer from a surprisingly short runtime, forgettable story and extremely linear progression system. Still, it’s better than this period’s AAA offerings.                             
80	                                Pushing out sheer pornography with its visuals while also testing you with fast paced combat, Bright Memory: Infinite teases you like a temptress. It brings you oh so close, then leaves you wanting more.                            
80	                                Bright Memory Infinite brings the ideas of its predecessor to a much more satisfying conclusion and comes within striking distance of many of the games it’s inspired by.                            
80	                                Bright Memory: Infinite is the product of a developer who wasn't satisfied putting out a game that he knew he could improve. So, instead of moving on, we get this over-the-top and insanely beautiful FPS adventure that is fun from beginning to end. Absolutely none of it makes sense, but who cares when I just launched an ancient sword-wielding statue dude in the air and cut him into pieces. Sign me up for the next adventure with Shelia.                             
75	                                Bright Memory Infinite is not without flaws, but thanks to the use of a fast and intuitive combat system it keeps the player glued to the screen for the two hours it takes to reach the end credits. To make the offer even more attractive is the method of distribution of the game, which can be downloaded at no additional cost by all owners of Bright Memory (who will find Infinite in the library starting from 12 November 2021). Furthermore, if you have not yet purchased the title, know that its price on the Valve platform is really negligible: only 8.19 euros. An element that cannot be ignored in the evaluation, which perfectly counterbalances the poor longevity of the adventure and a few too many edges.                             
74	                                This solo work demonstrates that a linear shooter campaign can be asentertaining as the largest open-world.                            
70	                                Bright Memory: Infinite is an incredibly mixed bag. The story is nonsensical and the bosses are a bit disappointing. However, the overall gameplay is immensely satisfying, and the graphics are incredible.                            
70	                                Short, fast paced and completely lacking in narrative value, Bright Memory: Infinite nonetheless proves a fun romp with tight combat.                            
70	                                I hope the game does well so that we can see more of Bright Memory: Infinite, as it could easily be an episodic game release and allow its developer to showcase even more of its dazzling visuals and exciting first-person gun and melee mechanics. For now, enjoy a short afternoon’s worth of shiny, stunning action that will leave you wanting more.                            
70	                                Bright Memory Infinite is still at best a visual tech demo. It's lack of quality of life updates and extremely short play time still makes me wonder if this was the full game to begin with. Still, the gun blasting and blade swinging action is bombastically fun. After all, this game was developed by one person alone. So kudos to Zeng Xian Cheng.                            
70	                                Bright Memory Infinite is a first step in the right direction but certainly not the premium shooter that many expected, since it's very short but also available at a very low price. The two hours needed to beat the game are a lot of fun, however, and we really hope this is just the beginning for this project.                            
70	                                For a short, replayable FPS game, Bright Memory: Infinite really is a stunning creation. Like its prequel, it is engaging, exciting and extraordinarily fun. Similar to many Resident Evil titles, it’s perfect for playing through multiple times, and it’s a game I urge any first-person shooter fan to play.                            
70	                                In many ways, Bright Memory: Infinite feels like an extended tech demo. The jaw-dropping action and stellar graphics would serve as a great selling point for any new platform and almost appear too good to be true. Developer FYQD Studio proved some killer concepts but didn’t evolve them across a more complete adventure. Short games aren’t inherently bad, but Bright Memory: Infinite leaves me wanting so much more and is full of unrealized potential.                            
70	                                Despite all my problems with Infinite, it's a game made by a single developer (for the most part) that was amazing looking enough that Xbox wanted to tie it to its then next-gen, now current-gen console.                            
68	                                Quotation forthcoming.                            
65	                                They call it "Bright," but it's more of a "Sufficiently Visible" memory. The crowning achievement of Bright Memory: Infinite is that it even exists. A one-person studio working with creating the work from top to bottom, with only minimal help from outside sources. While flaws certainly show themselves at an alarming rate, the core idea is satisfying fun. While more for those already engrossed with the everlasting FPS phenomenon, it's commendable just for the attempt.                            
65	                                Bright Memory: Infinite looks incredible for a game from a small development team, and the core sword-and-gun gameplay is fun enough. However, everything surrounding those two elements feel unpolished and poorly thought-out. The incoherent story, the non-combat gameplay mechanics, and general lack of quality control drag down the entire thing. If you're looking for a quick and breezy shooter to tide you over for an afternoon, Infinite might be fun for you. Otherwise, there's nothing here that you can't see in videos that show off its rain-soaked beauty.                            
65	                                Buoyed by beautiful visuals, great performance, and entertaining exposition, Bright Memory: Infinite still feels like a small part of a complete game.                            
60	                                Bright Memory: Infinite will go down as a largely impressive game held back by glaring shortfalls. The frenetic and uniquely compelling shooter/hack ‘n’ slash combat as well as the breathtakingly realistic visuals make for a worthy experience alone. Unfortunately, that narrative is told in a less than elegant way and the quick sprint to roll credits hold Infinite back from reaching its true potential.                            
60	                                Unskippable cutscenes made replaying the first few levels more of a chore than it should've been, and the same remains true if you opt to replay the whole game on a higher difficulty level after completing it. There's nothing else to do if you want to eke out some additional replayability, and Bright Memory: Infinite's short length is certain to put some people off. It's a fun shooter for as long as it lasts, though, offering a satisfying mix of fast-paced gunplay and dynamic action. It's also hard not to be impressed that this came from the talents of a lone developer. Unfortunately, a dismal stealth section, unintelligible story, and some major technical issues hold it back, while its terseness does make it difficult to recommend, even at a low price point.                            
60	                                Bright Memory Infinite gets in its own way, and occasionally takes the focus off of its strongest quality.                            
60	                                On the surface, Bright Memory: Infinite is a phenomenal showcase from FYQD Studio of what can be achieved with Unreal and that indies can look just as terrific as their big-budget counterparts. But in trying to throw so many ideas together into such a brief runtime, it feels more like a montage of cool gameplay moments rather than a great game as a whole.                            
60	                                Bright Memory Infinite is a disappointing follow-up to a prelude that made its share of promises. It’s a shame because a polished expansion on the original concept would have had a certain cult appeal, whereas Infinite feels watered down. It’s a pretty game, and best of all it’s free for those who lashed out for the prelude, but in the end, it plays like a game that got spooked by its own shadow and is a result of improbable ambition.                            
55	                                So, is there any reason to play Bright Memory: Infinite? Unless you’re curious about what can a single person achieve in the video games industry (at least in terms of development alone; Zeng Xiancheng had help from the publisher, composer, etc.) – there isn’t. Otherwise, you should pick any other shooter, especially Shadow Warrior, if mixing guns and swords sounds good to you.                            
50	                                Bright Memory Infinite's tight gunplay is simply spread too thin to make up for an otherwise uninspired experience.                            
50	                                There’s an upgrade system to offer up replayability and variation, but there’s just not enough about the world, characters, and story to elevate it above anything more than a fun tech demo to put your new GPU through its paces.                            
50	                                Bright Memory: Infinite is a matured version of the original Bright Memory, stripping away some of that game's excesses for a more put-together experience. That said, the story is still complete insanity (that's barely acknowledged by the characters), and it’s clear that this solo production cannot match its boundless ambition.                            
95	                                Football Manager 2022 is yet another improvement on the long-running series, one that brings the beautiful game to life more than ever before and recreates both the small and large moments that make the sport so engaging. The options are near limitless, and the game puts even more at your fingertips, from the Data Hub to improved staff meetings, all adding onto a revamped match engine. This is the closest Sports Interactive has come to perfection, with only small elements feeling aged and needing polishing.                            
95	                                Football Manager 2022 is about as close to the real thing as you can get, with some nice improvements that make it the ultimate experience.                            
95	                                Football Manager 2022 provides yet again a masterful experience full of new elements that keep on improving a near perfect videogame, which also becomes more and more demanding with each new entry.                            
90	                                Football Manager may be an annual release, but Sports Interactive continues to find ways to improve the best footy management sim out there. This is the installment to get back into the swing of things.                            
90	                                All said and done though, Football Manager 2022 is unsurprisingly excellent.                            
90	                                Football Manager 2022 is a great take on the most popular sport of the world. It provides ways for both casual and obsessive fans to get more involved with their favorite club or almost any other team they want. The new animation system changes the experience quite a lot, both visually and tactically. Some transfer action might feel a little unreal and the game still generates new players that sometimes make little sense. But this is a solid game with a lot of options and plenty of incredible moments.                            
90	                                Football Manager 2022 is the kind of game that doesn’t really need to change. Even if there’s no revolution mechanics wise, many aspects show a finer attention to detail, and there are some new factors to consider. A more complete and more fun game, that every fan of the franchise is sure to enjoy.                            
90	                                It's a must-play, the perfect next step for existing FM fanatics, and the ideal place to start if you've never dipped your toe in the deep end of management simulations. You'll be able to get started easily and stop playing after just one more game. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm off to lose 6-1 to Liverpool in a failed attempt to implement a Gegenpress at Reading FC.                            
90	                                Football Manager 2022 brings the management experience to the next level. With the addition of the extensive transfer windows and the Data Hub, the game feels even more realistic and you want to keep playing it for as long as possible.                            
90	                                Football Manager 22 is a spectacular title for soccer lovers and for fans of the saga. The new features fit perfectly, but it still has everything that has made it a world reference in terms of sports management videogames.                            
90	                                How does one innovate in what is already the best sports management simulator of this generation? Sports Interactive knows the answer: with gradual improvements and small adjustments. This translates in the introduction of the Data Center, a welcomed addition for stats enthusiasts. But Football Manager 2022 doesn't reinvent the wheel, because it doesn't have to. It's a franchise that gets deeper and deeper for players who want a true simulation, and more and more accessible for newcomers.                            
90	                                With more tools at your disposal than ever, this is a rich, realistic management simulation that delivers thrills both on and off the pitch.                            
90	                                Football Manager 2022 is the kind of Football Manager game many would have dreamed of. It fixes almost every weakness in the team, and had us thinking “just one more match” long into the night…It’s the best approximation of the drama and passion of football yet, and it’s downright essential for football fans.                            
90	                                Sports Interactive have done it again. The match engine roars into the modern era with significant and overdue AI tweaks, and whilst there are still some stale features the game feels deeper and easier to navigate than ever.                            
88	                                Quotation forthcoming.                            
86	                                Football Manager 2022 is a chapter of consolidation, which capitalizes on last year's revolution. Sports Interactive has worked hard to improve the game engine even more, with brilliant animations and a brand new AI, which has a strong impact on certain game situations, such as pressing and occupying half spaces. The introduction of the Data Hub and small changes to the interface makes Football Manager 2022 the umpteenth excellent chapter of the series, which for the occasion also lands on Xbox Game Pass.                            
85	                                Football Manager 2022 manages to successfully represent the complexity of soccer, but at the same time, it offers an accessible experience that anyone can enjoy. Hardcore fans will be thankful for all the additions, and newcomers will feel welcomed.                             
85	                                The veteran playmaker is still banging them in and deserves that new contract.                            
85	                                The new data center and the new animation engine are really welcomed in Football Manager 2022.                            
83	                                FM 2022 remains undisputedly the best choice for PC soccer management,but we are missing some groundbreaking innovations.                            
82	                                The feeling is that Sports Interactive wanted to perfect everything that was already working, trying to put a nice patch on what was wrong and postponing the innovations / revolutions to the post pandemic. It remains, however, the best football managerial simulation on the planet.                             
81	                                Football Manager 2022 marks a slow transition to a better game, and the third and final version next year promises to be even more exciting. This is is as good as always, but the new elements are less than we would have liked.                            
80	                                Don’t go into Football Manager 2022 hoping for great presentation or spectacular graphics, for you’re not gonna get it. No, this is more like „Looking at Excel Sheets: The Game“, but for what it is worth, it excels at that (pun very much intended). It’s complex, it’s slow, but if you find your way into it, it is also extremely satisfying once you get the hang of it.                            
80	                                Football Manager 2022 is no exception to the rule established by its long line: rule without sharing. This is exactly what the Sports Interactive game will do this season, as much by the absence of competition as by an impeccable mastery of its subject, reinforced by new features more likely to improve playing comfort. The Covid has certainly played, but this edition still lacks major changes to mark the occasion. When it comes to being the indisputable owner of your Steam library, football fan, you know the answer.                             
80	                                But each year should offer something slightly different. Partway through my Watford season, having somewhat steadied the ship and learnt more intricacies than I had in previous editions, I had the overwhelming urge to try something different. I began a new game, made myself unemployed, and got a job to start a root-and-branch revolution at Carlisle United; revamping the backroom staff as much as my miniscule budget would allow, building a squad around youth and poring over lesser known opponent’s stats in order to figure out the week’s gameplan. Plenty of other players would have taken a similar path in previous games, for sure. But I think that’s the point with Football Manager. And that it can still inspire different approaches from different players each year is impressive, even if it might not look hugely different on the surface.                            
80	                                There's certainly no debate about whether Football Manager 2022 is worth the money, that's self-evident for a game that offers thousands of hours of gameplay, but you won't be missing out majorly if you continue with FM 2021.                            
80	                                Football Manager 2022 is a good iterative step with the improvement of the matchday engine and the addition of the data hub. The data hub especially, as well as regular staff meetings, bring the franchise another step closer to the full management experience.                             
80	                                All in all, Football Manager 2022 is another sublime sports simulation. It once again proves that you can enjoy football games without directly controlling the players. Its new additions add to an experience already brimming with depth, and the refinement of the gameplay style means that you’ll struggle not to lose yourself within Sports Interactive’s digital training ground. Its proficiency on even the oldest of hardware means there’s really no excuse not to dive in. This is Football Manager at its best, the virtual equivalent of a top-corner goal.                            
80	                                Whether you’re taking West Ham to their deserved place at the top of the premier league, nervously preparing for the Bavarian Derby, or fighting bravely for scraps all the way down in the Vanarama leagues, Football Manager 2022 is a compelling simulation of what it’s like to actually manage a football club, with none of the risk of accidentally doing a Big Sam-esque gaffe. Still, if football and spreadsheets aren’t your bag, there’s nothing for you here.                            
75	                                Football Manager 2022 passes for a small update of the 2021 opus, which remains a great gateway to the license for apprentice sports directors.                             
70	                                Football Manager 2022 is a further step for the improvement of the series, which in terms of offer and managerial experience now seems saturated. The innovations compared to the previous edition are small and marginal, both in terms of content and improvements to the match engine.                            
90	                                Jurassic World Evolution 2 is the perfect sequel- it's bigger, better, and toothier than its predecessor in almost every way that matters.                            
90	                                Overall, Jurassic World Evolution 2 delivers on its promise of surpassing its predecessor thanks to improved dinosaurs, deeper management simulation mechanics, and game modes catering to different players. While Chaos Theory lets players visit and rewrite iconic moments in the film franchise, Sandbox Mode is undoubtedly the heart and soul of Jurassic World Evolution 2 for the way it highlights all of the new features and improvements.                            
90	                                Jurassic World Evolution 2 changes the game in more ways than one, letting players spend less time creating parks and attractions and more time reacting to a world where dinosaurs already exist.                            
90	                                Jurassic World Evolution 2 is bigger, better, and bolder, and smooths off some of the original’s rough edges. Frontier has tinkered with the management sim aspects, and brought in a canonical campaign into the mix that follows directly on from the events in Jurassic World Fallen Kingdom, but the dinosaurs remain the star of the show. If you’re a fan of the franchise – and really, who doesn’t love uncontrollable carnivores? – then Jurassic World Evolution 2 is a perfect sequel.                             
85	                                Jurassic World Evolution 2 is a much better game than its predecessor was at launch. That said, I can’t shake the feeling that much like the original, it’s only going to get better and more content-rich in the next coming year or so. It’s a beautiful trend from Frontier Developments that I think will make an already great game all the more excellent.                            
82	                                Despite being frustrated by the initial limitations of the Sandbox Mode and the lackluster campaign, I found a lot to enjoy and appreciate about Jurassic World Evolution 2. Chaos Theory is an engaging and creative way of blending the iconic films into the game, and the new aquatic and flying dinosaurs are among the best of many new animals. Building and managing a theme park full of impossibly ancient animals is challenging and rewarding, and despite some annoyances, the game also manages to retain many grin-worthy moments of wonder at the improbable. People and dinosaurs just aren’t meant to be in the same place at the same time.                            
82	                                Quotation forthcoming.                            
80	                                Jurassic World Evolution 2 is in every way better and more comprehensive than the original, but still lacks depth in the building mechanics and is too simple, especially for fans of the genre. However, designing and building your own Jurassic Park is a magical experience that everyone with a love for dinosaurs should experience.                             
80	                                If a few additions strengthen the depth of the game a little, such as scientists or territory management, others are a little more cumbersome without being unduly disturbing. If we would have liked more clear-cut news, we once again had a great time on Jurassic World Evolution 2, for a good twenty hours.                             
80	                                Jurassic Park Evolution 2 is a bigger, better and more balanced management simulation, that runs through the entire cinematic franchise. If you enjoyed the first game, you will definitely enjoy this one.                              
80	                                With a huge amount of content to discover, lovingly-crafted dinosaurs that feel truly alive, and the thrill of revisiting iconic moments from the franchise in Chaos Theory mode, this is the closest you’re going to get to running your own Jurassic Park in real life.                            
80	                                Jurassic World Evolution 2 features a deeper process of building and managing your park, despite constant threats that stop it from thriving.                            
80	                                Building on the immense foundations of the original, Jurassic World Evolution 2 provides more of the same addictive management gameplay with the thrill of seeing the prehistoric reptiles in all their glory. The new additions are light and there’s still some minor issues, but it’s all forgotten as you behold a T-Rex emerging from the shadows for the first time.                            
80	                                A bigger and better sequel which works as both a compelling management sim and a celebration of the Jurassic Park franchise.                            
80	                                The fact that Jurassic World Evolution 2 is a worthwhile game isn’t surprising. Frontier Developments has a fantastic track record with this kind of game, as proven in Planet Zoo or the first edition of this title. What works in this game’s favor is the expanded roster of dinosaurs, the new challenges and the fantastic animations and behaviors of the exhibits. Being a licensed game, the temptation towards being simple had to have been strong. Some would argue the first game swung to hard in the accessible direction. With this newest iteration, the game walks the line of easy to understand but deep enough to remain engaging. Despite frustrations, Frontier Developments, much like life, found a way.                            
80	                                If we had to make a list of things that are totally radical then dinosaurs chasing and eating annoying fannypack-wearing tourists while we triumphantly hum the Jurassic Park theme tune would be top ten. Maybe even top five. We're here for that. Minor quibbles with the main campaign aside, Jurassic World Evolution 2 delivers an entertaining if simplistic park builder, that well-utilises the Jurassic World license, and throws in just the right amount of dinosaur-fuelled mayhem to boot.                            
75	                                For now, enjoy the best Jurassic Park game we’ve had to date.                            
70	                                This then is the challenge with Jurassic World Evolution 2. If you're a Jurassic Film fan who also likes micromanagement, there's certainly enough meat on its dinosaur bones to keep you happy for a good long while. However, if you're more just a management sim fan, you'll probably find its quirky management style – sometimes hands-on, sometimes hands-off – a tad irritating, as well as the limitations of its console controls.                             
65	                                Jurassic World Evolution 2 expands its prehistoric playground with more dinosaurs, modes, and unique franchise flavor, but it’s all built on a flawed and often frustrating foundation of unbalanced and unpolished mechanics. Jurassic World Evolution 2 is a better game than its predecessor, but it feels like a glorified expansion. Those looking for a more substantial sequel may want to spare the expense this time.                            
55	                                If you enjoyed the original game, Jurassic World Evolution 2 is sure to bring you hours of entertainment (not including the “campaign”). However, for players hoping for more than a full priced DLC, disappointment is unavoidable.                            
90	                                Echo Generation does an excellent job of combining nostalgic feelings for the 90s with modern game development in a way that makes every second an enjoyable time. The characters are diverse and interesting, the combat is varied and fun, and the world is about as beautiful as it gets. Combine all of that with the fact that it’s launching on Xbox Gamepass, and it’s impossible not to recommend Echo Generation.                            
83	                                The Good Life is an open-world life simulator with detective overtones, strange and messy situations, plus transformations to cats and dogs.                            
80	                                Echo Generation is a simple but very enjoyable adventure which captures the magic of being young. It skillfully creates a sense of excitement and wonder, yet has enough going on to prevent it from becoming a repetitive slog; a trap similar games often fall into.                            
80	                                If you're a fan old school RPGs with unconventional gameplay, I would recommend Echo Generation. If you didn't grow up with those sorts of games but enjoy mysteries involving cosmic horrors like Stranger Things and Gravity Falls, I would also recommend this title. It's certainly a worthy addition to the Xbox's extensive library of great JRPG-styled indie games.                            
80	                                While Echo Generation stumbles a few times, our time with the game was never squandered. It's a testament to how wonderful its world is to explore, along with its engaging RPG systems. You never quite know what surprise will be in the next frame of the game. Will it be a mysterious alien spaceship? Or will you stumble across the legendary monster in the woods? The intrigue never lets up, and while the narrative itself doesn't quite land as well as you may hope, Echo Generation delivers an exciting adventure that Xbox Game Pass subscribers are not going to want to miss out on.                            
78	                                A great concept with the right amount of heart, that simply loses its way too often in so much broken form.                            
71	                                Echo Generation feels like one of those games that try to capture all the elements which made the older games interesting. No hand-holding, no easy setting, no guidance and very challenging. The art design is quite cool and it is what will lure to the game as it seems very chilled. But it’s a false sense of security the game is far from chilled and is decidedly tricky. Coupled with the creepy unnerving undertones of the story this game is not for the faint-hearted.                            
70	                                Echo Generation is a gorgeous turn-based adventure game with an awesome retro vibe. It doesn’t always live up to the adventure it promises, with combat sometimes feeling too lengthy or repetitive, and it’s not always clear what you should be doing, but if you’re browsing that Xbox Game Pass library and wondering what to try next, or if you’re looking for something that captures that sense of childhood adventure, you should give Echo Generation a try.                            
70	                                Echo Generation is visually striking, with a lot of intriguing concepts and solid combat and gameplay at its core. Unfortunately, a lack of focus with the narrative holds it back from being a truly impressive RPG. The boss battles alone might be worth the price of admission, and there’s still other bits to enjoy, but those looking for more meat would best be off searching for another tale of adventurous kids from decades past.                            
70	                                Echo Generation is an imaginative adventure that provides several doses of nostalgia for all who play. However, the battle system requires quality improvements. In its current state, a player could be forced to restart due to wrong choices made during early gameplay. Still, the adventure segments and character interactions are charming enough to warrant a weekend spent cracking this small-town mystery.                            
65	                                Voxel-rich graphics. A high-spirited Stranger Things vibe. Clever turn-based quick-time-event combat. But also dopey dialogue, endless fetch-questing, and weirdly placed grind. Echo Generation looks great, tastes half-baked.                            
60	                                It’s beautiful to look at and has an engaging turn based combat system but Echo Generation has a few core issues that undermine its best qualities. An unfocused narrative leads to confused and unclear quest lines which, combined with some curious design choices, means the game doesn’t manage to fulfil its obvious potential.                            
90	                                Lost in Random excels in storytelling and offers an unconventional combat system. If you like visiting unique worlds, enjoy dark fables and appreciate a good story, you’ll get hooked on this game big time. I was eagerly awaiting Alice: Asylum and suddenly this gem appeared. Here’s to more wonderful surprises like this one. [11/2021, p.74]                            
90	                                Lost in Random is all about randomness, and while that idea doesn't go far enough in some cases, the game is still a great coming-of-age tale with tons of laughs and tension.                            
83	                                Lost in Random would have been an interesting game even with a normal combat system, but developers were brave enough to dare and innovate, definitively not an easy task in late 2021. Maybe the effort spent on combining dice and cards has caused other features to be overlooked, and the game is sometimes a bit slow and with little interaction, but this does not impair the experience of playing an artistically very well done game, with a great story and the right amount of humor like I haven't seen in a long time.                            
80	                                Lost in Random is a 3D action game with a focus on deck-building with magical cards. By having the player roll a dice, the game brings an interesting factor of chance to the table, but it can not be denied that this element can also work against itself.                            
80	                                Lost in Random is an adventure I couldn't wait to continue as soon as I stopped playing. The wondrous deck building mechanics that gave rise to explosive effects, the visually impressive world, the whimsical soundtrack and the story of a young heroine rescuing her sister from an evil queen. There were a few frame rate drops and glitches, mind, but nothing that a day one patch won't smooth over. If you're after a game that is challenging yet thought-provoking, introducing you to sumptuous storybook realms that you won't want to leave, then this is one I wholeheartedly recommend.                            
80	                                Lost in Random depicts a stunningly unique and eccentric world filled to the brim with character and personality. The Tim-Burton visuals and the kooky cast of characters you’ll meet in each distinctively different region means there’s never a dull moment to this journey. Clever strategy card elements help to mask the game’s rather unremarkable real-time combat, with some control issues that hurt the overall experience. Yet despite its flaws, Lost in Random still brings the goods and had me engaged from unlucky start to triumphantly random end.                            
80	                                Interesting combat aside, what resonates and exhilarates about Lost in Random is its story first and foremost. The adventure that Even embarks on is one to savour and one that lives up to the wonderful art direction and visual design. The characters, the dialogue, the discoveries, the animation, the voice acting, the music, the presentation -- it all comes together wonderfully. A game well worth taking a chance and rolling the dice on.                             
80	                                Lost in Random is certainly a unique and interesting game, in spite of its flaws and aside from its inspirations. The art style may give the impression of journeying through a Tim Burton-inspired, imaginative landscape, but Lost in Random has its own identity that makes it worth exploring. Despite its faults, the combat's close similarities to 3D version of the Megaman Battle Network and Starforce series in all of the best ways makes it highly entertaining. Lost in Random is an innovative and enjoyable take on its genre, and a game that’s very easy to get lost in.                            
80	                                Amazingly stylish and fun, Lost in Random has everything it needs to be unique and intriguing.                            
80	                                Lost in Random enjoys an exquisite universe, between an artistic direction reminiscent of the golden age of stop motion and a particularly rich narration. Add to that combat mechanics cleverly built and well executed despite some redundancies and some under-exploited ideas. But in the end, Zoink offers us a fascinating macabre tale that never runs out of steam over time and is worth browsing.                             
80	                                Lost in Random is without any doubt the independent nugget of this end of the year. The creativity is at its peak and everything makes it a title not to be missed. Tim Burton-like art direction, an engaging story and above all an original and very addictive gameplay. Card game, chess game, board game, dice game... One could think that all this mix is a bit messy but everything is, on the contrary, well measured.                            
79	                                Lost in Random is a gothic tale with charming world-building and mature writing. The battle system unfortunately does not allow the whole project to claim a place in the undisputed must plays of the year.                            
78	                                Lost in Random is a pleasant action-adventure with a clever use of numbers, great visual design, and a unique combat system that allows players to roll with the punches.                            
75	                                Lost in Random performs expertly on its gameplay and graphics, but falls very short when it comes to its little effort in the dialogue aspect. It’s also a shame to see how little polish the ending received.                            
75	                                Charming and often fun, Lost in Random has less going on than I would have liked, even if I had a good time overall.                            
75	                                Even if it is a nice surprise, Zoink’s new game might not be its best. The combat system needs more depth or, at least, be better distributed throughout the adventure.                            
70	                                Lost in Random is an okay 15-hour game, front-loaded with seven fantastic hours. It’s worth playing even if you don’t make it to the end, simply because there’s never been another game like it. Disney goths will delight in its charming blend of cute and macabre, and there are some legitimate thrills to be had with the combat system for strategy-brained players like myself. If it had continued to innovate with new battle mechanics and more cards to collect throughout the entire game, it would be an easy contender for game of the year for me. Unfortunately, it rests on its laurels too early, and the game as a whole suffers for it. I would be eager to return to Random were there ever a sequel, but I don’t think I’ll be revisiting Lost in Random again anytime soon.                             
70	                                Even and Dicey’s Journey to save Odd and stop the Queen is well written and presented by the game’s action, music, and narrative, but it feels like there’s also varying degrees of jank just sitting in your periphery. Get past that, and I still feel this is a fairy-tale adventure that deserves a cover-to-cover read.                            
60	                                Lost in Random is a dark fantasy tale full of amusing characters and macabre manifestations of a world built on chance. It falls short, however, in trying to turn its dice rolling random element into a compelling action experience, and outside of combat struggles to come up with interesting things for players to do. An enjoyable story married to a game that’s far from offensive, but certainly a little bland.                            
85	                                Lost in Random basically accomplishes evereything it needs to: it tells an intriguing and original story that mixes innovative gameplay systems, it is not afraid to gamble and it pays off in almost every little thing. This is a game worth considering, both for how fun it is and how interesting it manages to remain.                            
85	                                Lost in Random is a game with a great fantasy story, an unforgettable art direction, an original battle system, and details that will make you smile at various times. It is a must-see title for anyone who has grown up reading and listening to fantasy stories and an adventure game that everyone should try.                             
80	                                The engaging story and captivating visuals of Lost in Random make you briefly forget its flaws.                            
80	                                If you enjoy the visuals, the originality of Lost in Random will probably ensnare you, with its weird but efficient alchemy of cards, narration and dice.                            
80	                                Aside from a couple of noticeable dips with less fleshed-out areas in the final act, Zoink held my attention for my entire 11-hour playthrough. That counts for a lot. If given the chance, I’d love to return to the world of Random in a possible sequel to Lost in Random that smooths over some of these first-game-in-a-new-series pitfalls.                            
78	                                Lost in Random is a very interesting game, built around an original concept and tied to it until the end, for better or for worse.                            
75	                                Lost in Random offers a highly enjoyable experience with rich, dynamic gameplay and an interesting plot. While it's weighed down by repetitive fetch quests and some bugs, it's easily still one of the most charming games I've played so far.                            
75	                                Like a toss of the dice, Lost in Random can be truly inspired at times, and a little underwhelming at others.                            
79	                                The look and tone is hilarious and non-sensical, but the gameplay is tight. So if you’re looking for something similar to a Devil May Cry, but thought Onechanbara was terrible, Ultra Age might be what you’re looking for. It plays better than something like Deadly Premonition, but doesn’t have quite the intentional derp of Metal Wolf Chaos. I’d say it sits nicely in the realm of something like God Hand. And if this is just a poorly presented game, it fooled me, and is still tons of fun to play.                            
75	                                Ultra Age is a no-brainer for indie action game fans. The adventure features seamless gameplay, fun boss designs, a low price, and the potential to create a franchise. It challenges the player to pay attention to enemy movements, create new playstyles and understand the game mechanics to the fullest while keeping it fun and creative. While the story has its shortcomings, I am sure with some added detail in the future; it can become a hit of its own.                            
70	                                Such a fresh-feeling combat system always has you thinking two steps ahead, especially in scenarios when multiple styles of foe are clashing. They’ll fight each other in these instances, but if you’re running low on, say, Katana blades, a Lightning Rod might be your best option. Souls-ish elements do rear their head via alternate routes that make up for harsh checkpointing, encouraging you to get back in the fight (regardless of how tough that encounter is). Discard initial assumptions; Ultra Age is a surprisingly fun slice-fest.[Issue#7, p.78]                            
70	                                Even though its production values are low -a given that’s is apparent almost everywhere in the game- Ultra Age can be a great choice for those who are seeking a well designed hack 'n' slash experience.                            
70	                                Ultra Age manages to convince with its fluent gameplay, supported by an elaborate skilltree that offers depth to each wieldable weapon. The impressive bossfights form the proverbial cherry on the cake. Graphically, however, this game looks like it's still stuck in the PlayStation 3 era.                             
70	                                Ultra Age bets it all on its own style of conventional combat and mostly succeeds as a result.                            
70	                                Ultra Age is the sort of game that you'd find for sale on disc heavily discounted within a couple of months of release during the PS3 era, yet take a punt on it and really enjoy yourself. Not actually a lemon, but definitely a bit citrussy. It's a fair action brawler with pyrotechnic combat and a fine line in roadblock bosses. But that's just fine.                            
70	                                This is a solid effort for an indie studio, and if you’re aware of its shortcomings, this can be a very interesting option for those looking for a hack & slash.                            
70	                                Ultra Age is a graphically dated action game, but it has a combat system that can offer an interesting rate and level of challenge.                            
65	                                Ultra Age is anything but ‘Ultra”, and that’s alright. While its not the best example of a modern-day Devil May Cry it is however an excellent example of Devil May Cry from the PS2 era. Whether on accident or on purpose the game felt just cheesy enough that it could be an homage to DMC’s heyday or maybe it is just a cheesy story about a kid looking to find the secret to immortality. Whatever side of the line you land on, the constant will be that Ultra Age is a lot of fun to play. While its systems might not be deep; the enjoyment of juggling combos/blades and enemies is worth the 7 hour length.                            
60	                                Ultra Age is a middle of the pack action thing that has the basic mechanics of the genre down, but doesn’t do anything to stand out, and it has some real balancing issues. but struggles to balance difficulty progression as well as pushing boundaries in the genre. Unfortunately for the developers, this is one genre in which we are spoiled for choice, both in terms of finding challenging games to enjoy, and complex, thought-provoking experiences.                             
60	                                How willing are you to forgive a title's flaws to enjoy its fights? This is the question to ask yourself if you are interested in Ultra Age. On the one hand, the title suffers from dated visuals and a jagged rhythm. On the other hand, his clashes benefit from animations and dynamic effects. By this ambivalence, the title remains to be reserved for fans of beat 'em up able to disregard many aspects to appreciate a rather nice gameplay.                             
60	                                If we were to evaluate exclusively the Ultra Age combat system we would not hesitate to say that it is a small pearl. Unfortunately, however, we find ourselves having to consider the entire package and it is therefore impossible not to take into consideration the serious problems of this production, which range from level design to the graphics sector, passing through some very questionable gameplay choices. The result is a poor offer in terms of content even for a product sold for 29.99 euros. In short, the purchase of Ultra Age should only be evaluated by the most hardcore fans of the genre who do not want to miss the opportunity to try the particular combat system on PlayStation 4 or Nintendo Switch (platform on which there is also a free demo).                             
72	                                Overall, whilst the general release of a Project Zero game onto modern consoles feels exciting, the long-beloved classic is no longer the same fright mongering experience we know the series for back on the original Xbox. Besides a few creepy images of certain ghosts, there is nothing that really causes much of a jump let alone a true scare, and whilst the story has the potential to be one of true Japanese horror, the horrible pacing and repetitive nature ensure that the Project Zero: Maiden of Black Water goes down as an underwhelming return for what used to be one of the greatest series in horror gaming.                            
65	                                Project Zero: Maiden of Black Water is an old-fashioned horror title capable of delivering many thrills thanks to a well-written storyline, anxiety-inducing atmosphere and unique gameplay, provided, however, you can turn a blind eye to the problems related to controls, the little care taken in graphics improvements and the lack of localization for several western languages.                            
65	                                The remastered version of Project Zero: Maiden of Black Water offers improved visual effects, additional costumes and a new photo mode that is quite deep. The problem is that in everything else the game fails. Although its initial premise is very intriguing, the game fails to develop its plot at a good pace. There is too much repetition in many of its main mechanics. All in all, the fact that the franchise has returned to Xbox after fifteen years is a merit.                             
60	                                Project Zero comes back to life with a lackluster remaster that brings no new features. On the other hand, it is always a good opportunity to dwell into its dark universe.                            
60	                                Project Zero: Maiden of Black Water is the weakest of the Fatal Frame games and this remastered version fails to address its biggest issues, namely clunky traversal mechanics and a seriously wooden cast of characters. However, look past these shortcomings and, especially for fans of the series, there's still a lot to enjoy in the solid ghost-snapping action on offer here. It may not be the best game in the franchise, but this remaster will still give your spine a good tingle if you let it.                            
60	                                Those who love the genre and will be able to forgive its many pitfalls.                            
60	                                A divisive entry remains as divisive as ever; Project Zero: Maiden of Black Water on Xbox offers a highly intriguing premise but is let down by a plot that progresses at a snail’s pace. You spend a lot of time in-game wading through water and this serves as a perfect metaphor for how playing the game feels.                            
40	                                Ultimately Fatal Frame: Maiden of Black Water ends up being a boring slog more often than a tense horror experience. The remaster will likely be welcomed by fans of the series, especially those that never had a Wii U to check out the original. However, any future Fatal Frame titles will have to evolve to feel at home in modern times.                             
90	                                It may have a half-baked premise, but don’t let that put you off of Ghostrunner. The gameplay far outweighs it, and once you get your head in the game, it’s so utterly rewarding. Hard, yes, but oh so incredible when you grasp it. Lose yourself in the visuals and synthwave as you rise to the top.                             
85	                                I found joy in Ghostrunner where some would find frustration. The precision that is needed to meander through waves of enemies and platforming challenges sometimes seems overwhelming. However, when you finally overcome that tricky section you have been dying over and over on for a while, the feeling is magnificent. The PlayStation 5 updates really enhance Ghostrunner, especially the Dualsense controller, I do feel this is the best place to play this unique title.                            
81	                                In sum, Ghostrunner on PS5 takes what was already a pretty compelling game and spruces it up just a very little bit. This is a short, narrowly-focused game that is built for speed — to that end, it does very well, but just know that going in and don’t expect a full-blown FPS-like experience. That in mind, I think you’ll appreciate what the devs were able to accomplish here.                            
80	                                The new Ghostrunner game can be a pain in the stomach sometimes, but at the same time it's one of the most unique first person action games that offers tons of fast-paced, fun gameplay.                            
80	                                Ghostrunner offers a nice cyberpunk adventure for patient players with it's fast action and next generation updates. It's not for every player, but it's definitely an experience that should be tried.                            
80	                                While the fast loading times and updated graphics show off the beauty of Dharma City's neon-grunge aesthetic and keep players in the action, it's ultimately the same experience. Screen Rant's first Ghostrunner review perfectly sums up the PS5 version's experience, in that it's "Sometimes Fast, Sometimes Slow." Ghostrunner is a great game that provides a proper adrenaline rush when everything works as intended, but those hoping for any significant changes in this next-gen version will be disappointed.                            
60	                                At its best, Ghostrunner provides truly thrilling action that feels alive. Rough level design and a few too many mechanics that don’t always fit together get in the way a little too often, though. There are definitely players looking for just what Ghostrunner offers, but they won’t find a smooth ride.                            
100	                                The storytelling, art and music masterfully connect to create a real sense of the world that the Eastward characters inhabit.                            
100	                                Match all of the above with a mesmerizing soundtrack of hummable motifs, from cheerily playful ditties to dramatic dirges, and everything in between, and Eastward distinguishes itself handily within its heavily populated genre. While it's not without its shortcomings - in particular, a bit less variety in combat and puzzles than the genre often typifies - where it shines, it does so brightly. For RPG fans, Eastward is the real deal, and it’s an unmissable and impressive feat of indie design that deserves plenty of recognition amongst a sea of bigger releases in 2021.                            
95	                                Eastward will fulfill any action-adventure needs that have been missing in your life. The character writing is fantastic and enhances the more emotional moments as the killer Miasma rears its ugly head. This game is an investment, but you’ll be left with a genuinely standout gaming experience full of action, exploration, memorable characters, and a fantastic final chapter. So do yourself a favor and play Eastward.                            
90	                                Eastward is truly a gem of the pixel adventure-RPG genre. It is plain as day that Pixpil poured their affections for this genre into making this game. They’ve provided fluid and expressive animation rarely seen in pixel games, lively characters, quirky writing, and catchy chiptune soundtracks. It is visually enticing from the beginning and will continue to keep you hooked until you are satisfied with unravelling its narrative. Eastward has easily taken its place as my favourite game of this year. I highly encourage lovers of pixel JRPGs to try this game out for yourselves. John and Sam will cook you up a satisfying adventure you will want to devour whole.                            
90	                                Eastward is an audio-visual masterpiece and a true indie gem in the action adventure genre, and even though it possesses relatively simple gameplay and puzzles, it oozes with great moments, beautiful world and heartwarming story with some of the most distinct and original characters in a while.                            
90	                                With Eastward, Pixpil succeeds in extracting the essence of the Mother games and transposing it into a Zelda-like game that highlights the complementarity between Sam and John, a particularly endearing duo. A real success, absolutely beautiful and endowed with a unique, bewitching and carefully written universe, that we recommend you to explore urgently.                            
90	                                A wonderful homage to classic RPG gaming that takes classic concepts and polishes them up with a level of care that is rare to find.                            
90	                                Eastward pays homage to all things loved about SNES-era gaming, looking and feeling like the games of our childhood locked deep within our hearts. At times, I wondered if the experience would be enhanced playing Eastward sitting cross-legged on the floor in front of a giant CRT television, tethered way to close to the screen by a wired controller. For gamers of a certain age, Eastward feels an awful lot like home, and one I didn’t realize I missed so dearly.                            
90	                                Eastward is not just the dazzling debut title of a very small development studio in Shanghai, just as it is not just a video game that closely resembles the best 2D Zelda in history. Don't call it Zelda-like: not because it's not a formally correct definition but because Pixpil's creature wants to be something more than the classic declaration of love to a title from the past. Eastward is one of the brightest examples of what are the true qualities of independent development: a real pearl that deserves to be discovered, perfectly capable of carving out its space in the niche of instant videogame cult. It is certainly one of the most surprising and impactful experiences of recent years, one of those titles capable of pointing the way to those who will come later.                            
90	                                A true Masterpiece. That's the word that comes after having accomplished this trip in the company of John and Sam. Varied level design, fascinating story, funny and endearing characters, fantastic visual and audio… Eastward has it all. Much more than a pale copy of its illustrious models, Pixpil's neo-retro game ticks all the right boxes to establish itself as a pure 2D action-adventure gem.                            
90	                                Eastward is an exceptional adventure game that does just about anything it does, and manages to hold its boat with a masterful hand in the 20 hours it takes to finish it.                             
90	                                All of that said, denouncing Eastward’s strengths and successes for any of the above would be disingenuous. It is a remarkable game that, while retro in ambition, will paradoxically go on to inspire the drive and uniqueness of future projects. It is clever, vibrant, and unapologetically original, and unless some magnificent twist of fate occurs over the next three months, it will undoubtedly go down as one of the best games of the year.                             
90	                                Eastward feels comfortably familiar and strikingly fresh all at once, remixing the best elements of classic RPGs to produce something bold, brilliant, and altogether new.                            
90	                                Eastward leans on fantasy to flavor its story, without forgetting about its core, real-world values. Its fluid, well-paced progression, and control movements thankfully allow you to explore and admire the view before continuing because Eastward is all about the journey despite its fascinating destination.                            
88	                                Eastward is a satisfying Zelda clone, with a beautiful pixel art and a compelling story.                            
85	                                Eastward is a beautiful travel with stunning 2D visuals, nice ideas and a good story that will stay with us for a long time.                            
85	                                While the combat isn’t anything special and the puzzles wear out their welcome, Eastward’s characters, setting, and sounds craft an unforgettable experience. If you’re looking for something quirky, captivating, and somewhat surreal, you’ve found it.                            
82	                                Eastward is a charming game, with the simplicity and "naivety" of JRPGs, but with its own unique personality.                            
80	                                The game mixes riddles, dialogues and fights very competently. It is very well-written and with more than 20 hours of playtime, there’s a lot to explore.                            
80	                                Perhaps Eastward’s greatest strength is that it isn’t complicated—gameplay is at once deeply warm and familiar without fading into stale territory, which is surprisingly tricky for a game that presents itself as a spiritual successor to the Zelda legacy. Eastward in motion is an unstoppable force, an exquisitely-animated homage to old-school RPGs that more than compensates for its writing and narrative                            
80	                                Eastward is a post-apocalyptic picaresque as charming as it is pretty, with simple action combat and puzzles that are accessible to everyone.                            
80	                                Though the primary plot would have benefitted from the energy placed in it’s characters, the adventures of Sam and John is still worth playing through. Many are likely to be drawn in by the music and visuals alone but the gameplay ensures its more than style. If you’re interested in a Zelda-like with a heavy story and character focus, then you can’t go wrong heading East. Given how great Eastward is for a debut game, I’m willing to patiently await many years for another.                            
80	                                Eastward is a marvelous action-adventure game designed in 16-bit pixel-art and set in a future and collapsed cyberpunk world. You play as Sam and John, two characters linked by a mysterious bound that decide to travel around the world to solve the strange things happening in the underworld. The art style is clearly inspired by 16-bit jRPGs and animation of the 90s. The adventure is full of smart puzzles to solve using the powers of the two friends, and will keep you busy and entertained for several hours.                            
80	                                Eastward is an enjoyable and arresting adventure, with memorable characters, likeable humour and a central mystery that keeps you engaged throughout.                            
80	                                Before I knew it, my initial skepticism and complaints had begun to evaporate. Even as a silent protagonist, John manages to exude so much personality from his non-committal shrugs and sighs, and he and Sam play off each other so well it’s hard not to feel endeared to them. Everything about Eastward just feels immediately magical and nostalgic, and while my gripes with the combat and stretched out dungeon designs never really went away entirely, Sam’s journey is still one I’m glad I went on in the end.                            
80	                                Eastward might fumble the ending, but that doesn't stop it from delivering a fantastic journey.                             
78	                                Worth playing for the atmosphere even though its pace and plot are uneven.                            
78	                                Although its gameplay is a bit flawed and its narrative can feel slow, Eastward is a game that rewards us for sticking with it with unique moments that become memorable.                            
75	                                Despite a few limits that stop it from becoming an instant classic, Eastward is a fun and relaxing ride that we believe it's worth taking for every 2D action adventure fan.                            
72	                                Charming and colourful pixel action-adventure with a lot of heart, solidcombat and puzzle dungeons, yet apparent deficiencies in the narrative pace.                            
70	                                Eastward’s action and puzzles play things a bit too much by the book, the plot and storytelling don’t really come together, and the dialogue lacks wit. But even with so many negative aspects, the top-notch pixel art is true craftsmanship. These wonderful graphics were enough for me to push through, and perhaps you will too.                            
70	                                Even for those players who are too young to perceive the winds of nostalgia blowing through Eastward, this is a game that shows the endurance of the Super Nintendo-era RPG template as a vessel for storytelling across decades - and that is a magic of its own, too.  [Issue#364, p.118]                            
60	                                In many ways, Eastward is the perfect evolution of 90s JRPGs, with its gorgeous artwork, endearing protagonists and well-designed dungeons that offer a satisfying blend of combat and puzzles. But it goes overboard with its story, packing in uninspired characters and giving them too much screen time. It’s a lot to sit through to get to the good bits.                            
50	                                Eastward is charming and offers a surprisingly dark story, but is bogged down by stale combat mechanics and too much boring and non-sensical dialogue.                            
90	                                You can't outrun the sheer horror of existence, but Jett: The Far Shore lets you try. Its heavy narrative is a perfect complement to its exhilarating gameplay.                            
80	                                Something special. A quick jaunt that lingers in the mind thanks to breezy movement, picturesque locales, and a story that offers plenty of tasty food for thought. [Issue#7, p.79]                             
80	                                All that may dent its mass-market appeal, but for open-minded players The Far Shore could well be 2021's most captivating videogame destination. [Issue#364, p.102]                            
80	                                While some annoyances stop Jett: The Far Shore from realizing its full potential, it's definitely a game that fans of experiences like Journey and Abzu might enjoy.                            
80	                                JETT: The Far Shore is a cathartic trip that makes you feel a part of something special in such an unknown and beautiful new world.                            
80	                                Jett: The Far Shore provides a truly otherworldly experience. With a unique look, stunning soundtrack, and a ship that controls like a dream, strap in and fulfill Jao's directive. Late game choices take the wind out of things a bit, but I still recommend taking a journey on the far shore.                            
78	                                Jett is a memorable space adventure that, interestingly enough, shines thanks to its gameplay and writing, even if both are flawed.                            
75	                                For better or worse, there’s nothing quite like this brave venture into the cosmic unknown, and it shows how sometimes it’s about a willingness to play by the rules of the universe.                            
70	                                A pleasant game for anyone willing to explore its abstract universe and general design. The story does captivate, helped with a great audio, but the end feels like unfinished.                            
70	                                JETT - The Far Shore is an adventure that, at its best, conveys a sense of absolute freedom to the player in the exploration of an alien planet. The setting is full of ideas ... and it is a pity that many of these are not fully developed during the story. From a stylistic point of view, the contrast between the minimal graphic style and the orchestral soundtrack is excellent and gives a unique character to the work.                            
70	                                Impactful and unique, JETT The Far Shore is an interesting space adventure, contemplative and thoroughly unique.                            
70	                                JETT: The Far Shore provides a solid experience with fantastic flying mechanics, interesting world lore and a keen grasp of the spectacle of space exploration.                            
70	                                Jett: The Far Shore is a stylish, fascinating, and challenging work of art that may inspire you to say some very naughty words. While it sometimes succeeds as a chill exploratory experience, iffy controls, poor navigational tools, and overly convoluted missions often harsh the game’s vibe. That said, if you’re the type that can appreciate a game for its world and message, despite some issues with its minute-to-minute gameplay, feel free to join the Jett set.                            
67	                                JETT reaches for the stars, and it is tantalising to watch it do so. It’s a shame that the camera cuts away just as it looks like it’s going to get there.                             
65	                                JETT: The Far Shore is home to a compelling cast of characters and a narrative worth playing and paying attention to, but it ultimately misses its mark and the less than compelling gameplay only further drags it down to an experience that overall feels just okay, and potentially downright boring if you're not gripped by the narrative.                            
65	                                What you will have to take note of, is the totally inconsistence frame rate. The game often chugs and gets choppy at certain points for no discernible reason, with some of the bigger set piece moments running fine, while regular exploration at high speeds can really have an impact on performance. I wouldn’t say it’s terrible, but definitely noticeable when they’re often unexpected, and happen often enough that you never truly forget about them.                            
63	                                It wasn't clear before release what Jett: The Far Shore wanted to be, which was as alien as its setting. Unfortunately it is not even now. It is a not at all veiled reference to the intuitions of No Man's Sky, but having adapted that playful structure to a narrative that exists and also has not indifferent apexes. The problem is almost entirely in the gameplay, which together with unresponsive controls transforms even the simplest of activities into a grueling struggle with the game system. A real shame, unfortunately, since the game was intended as a placid and relaxing experience.                             
62	                                JETT: The Far Shore is an ambitious game that is unrelenting in its vision. Placing peaceful exploration at the forefront, missions lack direction and purpose. Although great when flying long distances, the Jett encounters many issues in compact areas. With stiff movement, dull missions and frustrating enemies, JETT: The Far Shore falls short of its ambitious goal.                            
60	                                Creating a game about making a home on foreign land was never going to be easy, and JETT had boldly sought to subvert the themes of colonialism that are so inherent to tales like these. But upon putting down the controller, I mostly felt let down by how little it had to say on the subject. While it touches on other topics, such as the terrifyingly big expanse of space, versus our miniscule existence in the greater scheme of things, these weren’t enough to make up for its flaws. In the end, I just wish JETT had the confidence to pursue what I know it wants to be: to subvert expectations on the well-trodden ground of survival stories.                            
60	                                JETT: The Far Shore makes a good first impression with its retro sci-fi visual design and expressive flight model. But it’s difficult to connect with its story and your team when you have limited scope to make discoveries and supposedly dangerous events prove trivial to deal with. Only in the final stages does it let you spread your wings a little, and feels more powerful as a result.                            
60	                                While it presents itself well and has some neat ideas, Jett: The Far Shore never launches into the stars. Flying around, soaking in the atmosphere, and gathering info on a foreign planet is relaxing fun, but it's scuppered by messy combat scenarios and a story that falls flat. You may get some enjoyment from this, as does have its moments — just don't expect it to hit the stratosphere.                            
60	                                Jett: The Far Shore is a frustrating jaunt through space, with a stunning world and narrative let down by clunky, awkward controls.                            
60	                                JETT: The Far Shore is a space opera with a soundtrack so outstanding, an art compartment so beautiful, and a narrative premise so compelling that in the end it really hurts to find out that it's just an old-fashioned, “normal” video game. This team can and will create something a lot more compelling.                            
55	                                JETT: The Far Shore has moments of brilliance, but they're buried under an overload of mechanics that aren't enjoyable and a general lack of polish. Similarly any philosophical value in its narrative ideas is ruined by needlessly obfuscated dialogue. There's something to be discovered here, but it's just not worth the trip.                            
50	                                Beautiful and elegant though it may seem on the outside, the game too often lets its stylistic tics drag the experience into varying degrees of frustration.                            
50	                                Jett: The Far Shore is at its best when you're speeding through the air and provided with the agency to figure out how to reach your destination, not slowly hovering around a space and having someone hold your hand through every step of a puzzle. Regular occurrences of the latter drag down the whole experience, and the overall narrative--though intriguingly set-up--ultimately ends in an unfulfilling way, with protagonist Mei feeling too detached from the story and the themes it's trying to explore.                            
90	                                This game is excellent. It plays nicely, has solid cultural resonance, and actually respects the player's time, as it's only around 20 hours or so in length (while not compromising on the narrative quality). This is easily one of my favourite games of the year, which is why I wanted to do something a little special in reviewing it.                            
89	                                I had a great time playing Xuan Yuan Sword 7 and can only hope that Western gamers will get the chance to experience more games in the series at some point. We’ve clearly been missing out on a compelling series if this entry is any indication! It might not have reinvented the action RPG wheel, but Xuan Yuan Sword 7 is a well-rounded and incredibly solid take on the genre with a phenomenal story at its core.                            
80	                                Between stunning performances, a sharp new script, gorgeous, cinematic presentation, and the fluid action that ties everything together, it tells that story beautifully. Xuan Yuan Sword may not be a well-known name in the west, but it should be—and Xuan Yuan Sword 7 is a wonderful demonstration of why.                            
80	                                With Xuan Yuan 7’s action, story, and various systems all clicking into place so well, Domo Studio has given the world a truly superb video game.                            
70	                                As much as we enjoy our first taste of Xuan-Yuan, it’s definitely rough around the edges. We experience framerate drops whenever we go near rivers, hitboxes not being where they should be, and some oddly endearing animation jank. But as long as you’re fine with that, you’ll have a good time hacking through it. [Issue#8, p.84]                            
70	                                I came into Xuan Yuan Sword 7 as a complete newcomer to the series, as many likely will. What I walked away from after a 20-hour campaign was a solidly enjoyable, if not amazing, addition to the stable of action RPGs I have had the pleasure to experience. While early hours charmed me with an unusual setting, beautiful production values, and a fun combat system, some small cracks became apparent before long. However, this is a case of criticism coming not from a place of discontent but rather from a strong desire to see small kinks ironed out in an otherwise promising “new” IP. It’s got the potential to be a major contender, with some room left to grow into something even more impressive in the next installment.                            
70	                                Xuan Yuan Sword 7 tells a compelling story with gorgeous scenery and loveable characters, but it’s difficult to recommend to just anybody. I’m usually not one to knock game length, but a linear 15 – 20 hour experience for $49.99 is a harder sale than most. If you prefer story and style over combat and gameplay, Xuan Yuan Sword 7 is a no-brainer, its focus on familial bonds between brother and sister absolutely heartwarming. If you’re looking for a little more action in your ARPGs, Xuan Yuan Sword 7 probably won’t give you the satisfaction you’re expecting.                            
70	                                I had plenty of fun with Xuan Yuan Sword 7. Though I wish the story would have been a little more engaging, the fun yet straightforward combat and exploration kept me going until the end, that said the game does suffer from some lousy difficulty spikes and forgotten mechanics that are introduced early on. It's the seventh core title in the franchise, and I'm hoping it's not the last one to make it to western shores.                            
65	                                Overall, Xuan Yuan Sword 7 is a completely mediocre game. That isn't to say it can't be fun or doesn't have strong moments, but somehow, none of what it does really stands out. It's interesting to see a long-running franchise finally get its chance to shine outside of its home country, but Xuan Yuan Sword 7 doesn't do enough to set it apart from the crowd. There are a lot of interesting ideas here, and I look forward to seeing what the next entry shows off.                            
60	                                While I generally enjoyed my time with Xuan Yuan Sword 7, it’s hard to recommend. Those who can deal with the mediocre and sometimes unfair combat may be able to enjoy the world and story, and there is something to be said for games that can wrap things up in around 15 hours or so, but that’s still a significant amount of time to deal with issues that really need more polish.                            
40	                                This action RPG boasts a simple yet quite bearable combat system and beautiful environments. But the level design is nothing short of a tragedy and so are the preposterously long loading screens.                            
90	                                Xuan Yuan Sword 7 on Xbox is a uniquely special action role playing game which sweeps players into a fascinating setting; one that fuses ancient Chinese history with folklore. The game world is presented in stunning detail, and the world building feels organic and captivating. It also helps that this is an entertaining game to pick up and play, with rich environments to explore and a great deal of enjoyable variety in the gameplay.                            
82	                                If there’s a sticking point to really enjoying Xuan Yuan Sword VII, it’s that not everyone will respond to its pace and insistence on story and character over action. While its mythology, history and politics are firmly rooted in Chinese culture, this 20-hour family drama is moving, universal and entirely relatable, and its action is rewarding. For those with patience, Xuan Yuan Sword VII is a unique and memorable action roleplaying game experience.                            
80	                                An interesting Chinese aproach to ARPGs. The combat is fun and frenetic.                            
80	                                Despite these missteps, Xuan Yuan Sword 7 surprised us with just how fun it was. It harkens back to classic adventure games from the early '00s, filled with all the charm of that era. Sometimes it's refreshing to play a game that knows exactly what it wants to be and accomplishes it with very little getting in the way. While there are some localisation issues, some presentation problems and a lack of challenge in its combat, we do hope Xuan Yuan Sword 7 finds an audience in the west, as it would be a shame not to see how the next entry can build upon these solid foundations.                            
75	                                If you were a fan of the original Xenosaga game on PS2; then you will be comfortable with cutscenes and exposition in Xuan Yuan Sword 7. It really is a beautiful game with a heartwarming albeit mature story to tell.                            
75	                                Xuan-Yuan Sword 7 is a curious and fun insight into a franchise that hasn’t seen much air outside of China. Solid combat, with detailed upgrade systems, underpins a compelling story.                            
70	                                Xuan-Yuan Sword 7 might not be the game of the year, but it is a well made and memorable experience that has some of the most beautiful landscapes that games can offer.                            
58	                                Xuan Yuan Sword 7 is a dull, uninspired action RPG that never rises above mediocrity, and unless you really want to waste 20+ hours on something that’s totally generic, I don’t see why you’d want to bother.                            
50	                                An ancient Chinese character tale rather than an epic, Xuan Yuan 7 is a linear RPG that takes inspiration liberally from the best games around, but has no idea how to implement anything it’s stolen. Combat is farcically easy, systems are barely explained, puzzles feel decades out of date and there’s that stamina bar that does nothing. Sometimes there’s a reason you haven’t heard of a series.                            
90	                                Lemnis Gate feels like a bold breath of fresh air. The game is a dramatic new take on the genre that has been fully embraced to its bones. Lemnis Gate is a must for any fans of shooters and strategy titles, especially for players who have a friend to bring along for some 2v2 matches. The future looks pretty bright for Lemnis Gate, and it has more than earned it.                            
84	                                With its well executed timeloop concept, Lemnis Gate could be the sleeper shooter of 2021.                            
82	                                An FPS with a brilliant concept ad a great execution, plagued only by some matchmaking problems and a bland art direction. Not many players are playing it as of now, and it's truly a pity, since it deserves a lot more attention.                            
80	                                Quotation forthcoming.                            
80	                                Even if you are not a fan of competitive multiplayer, Lemnis Gate is worth checking out due to its highly original mechanics, tactical sandbox abilities, and fluid shooter action.                            
80	                                Lemnis Gate is a clever and damn well-designed game. Emphasizing tactical choices over pure skill, this original turn-based shooter impresses. Its successful concept mixing FPS and time loops gives rise to refreshing clashes. Too bad some of its content neglects strategy in favor of less interesting direct confrontations. Hopefully his already sparse player base doesn't dwindle too quickly, as Lemnis Gate follows through on his excellent concept.                             
75	                                A game that will test your trigger finger as well as your strategic planning, Lemnis Gate is a refreshing entry into the competitive shooter market, forming a solid foundation full of promise and subtle charm.                            
75	                                Lemnis Gate shows us a tremendously original evolution to conventional shooters, adding strategic touches that can make more than one fall in love. Although it has a very basic execution with characters with very little personality, the speed to play games, the decisions we must take and the countless options we have in our hands to win the rounds makes it a very good choice for strategy lovers this fall.                            
70	                                Lemnis Gate has some interesting FPS and time loop mechanics that make for engaging strategic gameplay. While it might not come with a thrilling story, it does deliver a unique gameplay experience that will be enjoyable for FPS and strategy fans alike. Some of the game’s modes do start to feel repetitive after a while, but Lemnis Gate comes packed with four modes, different match formats, and several different characters to keep things interesting. If you’re a fan of the casual FPS format typical of games like Overwatch or Apex Legends but are keen for something new, Lemnis Gate will provide plenty of entertainment.                            
70	                                I’m enthusiastic for the future of Lemnis Gate. You can play for hours and never see the same map twice, and you can play for an eternity and never have two identical matches. There is so much depth and strategic potential that it feels like you could spend a lifetime learning the game and inventing new strats and synergies. The turn based, asymmetric nature of the game makes it feel like a competitive shooter for people that don’t like shooters, and I’m always impressed when a game can cast a net so far outside of its core audience. Unlike a lot of team-based indie games, Lemnis Gate can theoretically survive with a much smaller player base thanks to only having 1v1 and 2v2 game modes. Despite its inaccessible premise, Lemnis Gate has a lot going for it and I’m excited to see how deep the wormhole goes.                             
60	                                Though it’s been marred by a shaky launch, and it’s difficult to explain to your mates, Lemnis Gate’s issues don’t dull the brilliance of its ideas.                            
90	                                Here’s a proof that it’s possible to create an engaging game based mainly on dialogues (comparisons to Disco Elysium work in Gamedec’s favor, but there’s a lot less text to read here). Gamedec’s world is original and immersive, the investigations are interesting, the detective’s unique skill system works great and the deduction mechanic is brilliant. [11/2021, p.54]                            
90	                                Gamedec should be an essential play for fans of isometric, story-driven titles. The detective work is paced and executed in a way that makes you feel like you're actually solving crimes, rather than following scripted conversations. The environments are varied and interesting, and the music absolutely slaps. This is a title that deserves your time and attention.                            
90	                                Overall, Gamedec is an excellent attempt to do the impossible. Tabletop games are as popular as they are today because they can’t be replicated anywhere else, but Gamedec comes as close as possible to making it a reality. I felt like my choices truly mattered, and that’s not something that happens often in games. While some of the virtualias can feel a bit tedious, the overall narrative they serve makes the experience worth it.                            
88	                                The deduction mechanic reminds me a little bit of L.A. Noire but perhaps a bit more forgiving here. I found it to be a fun world to jump into and I can only imagine what it would be like as a real VR game. For the variety of game worlds you get to play in (to an extent)… it’s pretty good value for money and if you enjoy a good detective story and the chance to solve problems via deductions, this should be right up your dark alley.                            
85	                                Despite being a little rough around the edges, Anshar Studios' first RPG attempt in the cyberpunk world of Gamedec manages to hold its own against even AAA ventures in the genre.                            
84	                                A captivating detective narrative that fascinates with its unusualtech-noir setting and a myriad of ways to solve the game.                            
83	                                There’s a lot in Gamedec that’s praiseworthy. I love how the game constantly evolves based on decisions made throughout it, and the story itself developed into something truly memorable as it progressed. Those who want to play an engaging cyberpunk sci-fi RPG with an emphasis on decision-making may very well want to try Gamedec out, especially now that it is updated and more polished.                            
82	                                Gamedec was a nice surprise: a cyberpunk detective story with a progression system that rewards intuition and perseverance without holding the player's hand. The dense network of questions and answers, together with the different endings available, guarantees robust replayability.                            
80	                                Overall, Gamedec delivers on its premise. It's a fun and intriguing story with plenty of choices to make and cases to solve. It never gets remarkably deep in lore, world-building, or character development, but it pulls off the decision-driven storytelling quite well. The limited scope hurts the experience, though. Environment maps can be small and feel on rails even when they're not, and some cut corners distract from what is a thoroughly entertaining narrative experience.                            
80	                                Gamedec is one weird Polish gem that comes both unpolished (pun intended) andinnovative and creative. It truly is a true role-playing game with great and interesting mechanics that incentivize player choice, although it suffers from various tiny gameplay design problems and lack of finishing touches that would make it a truly defining video game that can rival paragons of the genre like Disco Elysium.                            
80	                                Gamedec’s worlds are fascinating, albeit silent at times, and are made even more absorbing knowing there is a lingering feeling of dread in the air. It touches on some dark subject matter that makes for an interesting read and its branching narrative gives you multiple ways of enjoying the overarching story. Like a sci-fi novel, Gamedec requires your full attention otherwise you may get overwhelmed or bored of it before you turn the final page.                            
80	                                GameDec does right by the cyberpunk genre by using it as a backdrop to an excellent detective story. The series of virtual worlds makes for a diverse range of environments, filled with characters that all have their own unique characteristics and motivations. The lack of a fail state raises the stakes, and makes it important to learn the ins and outs of dialogue and deduction. Though some bugs and missing functionality can make it rough around the edges, GameDec is still an overall quite enjoyable experience.                            
78	                                Gamedec is very much focused on its setting, story and investigation-based gameplay, which are for the most part properly executed.                            
75	                                Give Gamedec a chance if you want to experience something different in the isometric RPG genre. This is an original cyberpunk creation, a well-constructed experiment that may not look or sound the best, but allows you to become engrossed in the story of a detective spending time on investigations inside video games. And that's pretty cool.                            
70	                                Although Gamedec offers a beautiful detective adventure, it cannot fully assess the great potential it contains.                            
70	                                Gamedec seems to show exactly how far you can pare down a cRPG, stripping away some of the deeper mechanics to streamline a tabletop-inspired experience. Those new to the genre will enjoy this opportunity to get their feet wet, while established veterans will feel this virtual “one-shot” campaign was executed succinctly. If you love cyberpunk detective stories and want something that will absolutely suck you in for 10 – 20 hours, you can’t go wrong with Gamedec.                             
70	                                Gamedec has a lot of interesting ideas and mechanics, and its hardboiled- detective-in-the-22nd-century story is a great premise. Either the developers had ambitions beyond their ability to deliver, or maybe the game just needs a few more passes with the random orbital sander to smooth down the rough edges, but in its present state Gamedec’s flaws definitely detract from an otherwise intriguing experience.                            
70	                                Gamedec is a good and ingenious crpg. Unfortunately, despite being also a good cyberpunk detective story, there are sequences that feel underdeveloped and unpolished.                            
67	                                Embellished with pleasant graphics, the title of Anshar Studios offers an interesting story and a considerable amount of text. Unfortunately, all those nuances that would have made it more interesting are missing, such as a more intelligible progression system and the presence of secondary activities disconnected from the dialogues which instead represent the only backbone of the game.                            
65	                                I want to fully endorse Gamedec, and up to a certain point I do, but I would be remiss if I didn't mention the radical shift in the game's focus. Up until then the investigations are mysterious and fun, telling a legitimately interesting tale. After it the game feels like it goes into hyperdrive, not stopping until the credits roll. If this universe is ever revisited, I would hope there would be more investigative stories and less weird color-coded mazes. As it stands then, Gamedec is best described as a promising title with uneven execution.                            
60	                                Gamedec certainly doesn’t lack ambition. Its setting is well thought-out and provides a rich tapestry to fall back on when the player’s actual interactions with the world come up a little wanting. While its aesthetics are great, a bit more attention was needed in the audio department, as music is generally only adequate and there are entire sections devoid of music altogether. Voice-overs are likewise notably absent. The all-important investigations struggle to gel during the game’s first half, and while the narrative eventually picks up a bit more, it’s clear there were some missed opportunities here. Overall, Gamedec presents a rich world that would be worth revisiting again, though perhaps with an extra layer of polish needed for its narrative.                            
60	                                The genre of Cyberpunk has been the “in” thing for a while now and I’m not sure why but it seems to get it right. It may be that the world is so complex and filled with so much grey within the black and white that games struggle with adding in the tiny touches that make Cyberpunk worlds really come alive. Gamedec has the lore, but it doesn’t go that extra step further to really incorporate it into the world. Gamedec doesn’t seem to know the benefits of the phrase “less is more” and instead of trusting in the beauty of the world it created, stuck its fingers into too many narrative pies. What is left is a pie full of so many ingredients that it’s hard to tell what the flavour of it actually is; it’s tasty and looks good, but you may be too full to go back for seconds.                            
60	                                The VR focus allows for a portrayal of human ennui and general hopelessness on a large scale; here is a whole subculture of people running from an unfavorable reality, hoping to eke out a marginally better virtual existence even if the only way to access it is to buy the equipment and pay for a subscription. It’s a good setting that I would be curious to see more of, even if Gamedec’s initial exploration of it stumbles out of the gate and comes alarmingly close to a total faceplant.                            
60	                                Underneath stability problems and bugs lies one of the most ambitious games I’ve played, bringing a tabletop game level of choice to RPG enthusiasts. The rich story and excellent writing delivers in a huge way...if you can get the game to cooperate.                            
60	                                Gamedec is based on a neat idea, that in some ways similar to Beautiful Desolation, but the game sadly crumbles under its own ambitions.                            
58	                                Gamedec is half of a good RPG and falls far short of its tantalising premise.                             
55	                                Gamedec's ideas are interesting and so is its imagination. But what disappoints about the work of Anshar Studios is how the concepts were concretized and how ineffective the dialogues are - both in describing the world (the discovery of which will only be possible by reading dozens of codex documents), and in telling the characters and their emotions.                             
50	                                Even with some refreshing concepts related to investigations, Gamedec stumbles owing to uninteresting plot points, bland characterization, unclear systems, and pesky bugs.                            
95	                                Life is Strange: True Colors is the best adventure in the LiS franchise, by far. A warm story about empathy, and the effect of it, that will leave a mark in your soul.                            
90	                                Life is Strange: True Colors is just as much a story about Asian American heritage, mental illness, broken homes, and systemic failure as it is a drama centering around dealing with loss, regrets, and trauma. Alex, up until the events of the game, is forced to hide her emotions for fear of alienating everyone around her and appeal to potential foster homes. She despises her father—a first-generation Chinese immigrant—for leaving her and her brother after their mother died from an illness. Alex calls herself “broken,” and it’s only until she reunites with her brother Gabe that she finally begins the process of healing.                            
90	                                Sure, parts of Life is Strange: True Colors are really bleak, but ultimately it’s an uplifting, heartfelt story about what it means to find your own version of home. It tells that story in a way that feels perfectly sincere, which is something that is hard to come by in games nowadays. True Colors has officially redeemed the Life is Strange series in my eyes.                            
90	                                Life is Strange: True Colors delivers an engaging and emotionally cathartic tale along with a surprisingly fulfilling new power. Its earnestness may not be for everyone, but fans of the series will find much to enjoy with this Deck Nine outing.                             
88	                                No matter if you are a longtime fan of the franchise or if this is your first time, we highly recommend "True Colors" to anybody who appreciates great stories (with some twists) and well-written characters. Don't miss this one.                            
85	                                If you were already a fan of Life is Strange, then Haven Springs is absolutely worth a visit. True Colors doesn’t introduce much new, but it continues the series' strongest points in a powerful new story that’s sure to have you chasing it down until the very end. And while the PlayStation 5 performance left a lot to be desired, it didn’t discount the experience enough to stop me from playing. Alex Chen will have a place in my heart for a good while.                            
85	                                A mature tale about empathy that shows us the beautiful & difficult facet of life in an emotional rollercoaster ride.                            
85	                                True Colors is a fantastic narrative experience, filled with rich characters and taking place in a beautiful, enchanting world. It is heartfelt and at times powerful, touching on the nature of grief, loneliness and belonging. True Colors will delight fans of narrative games, but is unlikely to win over the doubters. You probably know if you’ll like this one, and I’m here to tell those people that they won’t be disappointed.                            
85	                                Life is Strange: True Colors is very much a Life is Strange game in all the right and wrong ways. The new characters and plot provide a refreshing new take in the series and an enjoyable experience overall.                               
80	                                Life is Strange: True Colors opens phenomenally well and then somehow loses its way, never really knowing if it wanted to tell a cheesy conspiracy story or dive completely into slice-of-life territory. I wish it chose an identity. Most of all, I wish it took some chances. I don’t want to say the series is growing stale, but there’s certainly a careful balance needed between giving fans what they expect and reinventing some aspect of itself. This is a cool world to get lost in over a weekend, but it may float on by as a passing phase.                            
80	                                Even if it feels like you've already played it a few times during its the first hours, Life is Strange True Colors feels definitley fresh thanks to its writing and lovable characters - thanks to its voice actors. The power of its protagonist could have been used in better ways in terms of gameplay, but this trip to Haven Springs will definitely captivate players in need of emotions.                            
77	                                Life is Strange: True Colors lives up to the bar of the saga and deals with the subject of emotions in a responsible and realistic way. It's BSO is wonderful and despite having some bugs, the overall result is neat and we will enjoy it.                            
75	                                True Colors takes advantage of the new generation platforms to present the best looking Life is Strange game yet, and as a result the player feels more connected to the characters and the overall story telling quality also improves. But other than this, the latest Deck Nine's game doesn't have much more to offer.                            
70	                                When it comes down to it, Life is Strange: True Colors tells a good story, includes a strong cast of characters, and feels like a suitable successor in what is a reliable line of adventures that deal with tough topics. It has heart and people who enjoy adventure games and the series will likely fall in love with Alex, Steph, Ryan, and Haven Springs. If someone isn’t into the series though, it might not be the installment that changes their minds and makes them a fan.                            
60	                                A gripping story, beautiful landscapes and convincing characters. Life is Strange: True Colors looks very promising, but still this game could not fully convince us due to the slow pace and sluggish dialogues.                            
90	                                Impressively interesting title which takes you golfing in a dystopian wasteland called Earth. While golfing your way through abandoned cities and listening to a Martian radio station, you will discover what had really happened to our once great society. Golf Club Wasteland is using nonlinear storytelling to a great extent and it is a truly amazing experience.                            
85	                                There’s no shortage of story in this golf adventure around a post-apocalyptic wasteland.                            
85	                                Golf Club: Wasteland is a good game but not because of the quality of its actual golfing experience. Putting balls into holes is serviceable. There are some well-designed levels but there are also some frustrating ones. Don’t feel any guilt if you play on Story mode and get as much of the narrative as you can, without bothering with hazards or limits. But the developers at Demagog understand how to create atmosphere and how to let the world tell a story. Radio Nostalgia is an impressive achievement, especially the songs. The team does need to find a game theme and a set of mechanics that allows them to flex their world-building muscles in more expansive ways than Golf Club: Wasteland can.                            
85	                                If you are in search of a good golf game, leave it be, but if you want a good story, you will find one of the most significant games of the year.                            
85	                                A beautiful blend of whimsical golfing and sardonic commentary wrapped in a blanket of nostalgia and straight-up vibes. Golf Club: Wasteland is a brilliant narrative experience that can’t resist imbuing anything and everything with stories.                            
80	                                Golf Club: Wasteland can be seen as a kind of skillful outlet, a highly relaxing experience carried by a peculiar post-apocalyptic vibe and effective minimalist gameplay. In particular, we get an impeccable soundtrack, intelligently alternating between musics and precious testimonials for the scenario context. And if the adventure is short, it is given good replayability.                             
75	                                In the end, however, Golf Club Wasteland didn’t need to sell me on its main character for it to work. It tells more than a story about one person or one moment. Instead, its strength is in the world it creates, the microstories of each level, and the layers of social critique in each part of its radio broadcasts. The rich will watch the world burn and complain about the glare―best make sure that golf course is shady.                            
72	                                Golf Club: Wasteland is a super stylish puzzle-golf game which works better as an interactive drama than a golf game. The shooting system is shallow and brings into the experience too much "trial and error", but the atmosphere, the radio sounds and Charley's meaningful story give a melanchonic and charming dimension to the game.                            
60	                                Golf Club: Wasteland is a rather standard golf game bolstered by an experimental narrative approach. This iteration is, have no doubt, an improvement on the niche ideas therein, and for that, I applaud the developers. However, good as these ideas are, they suffer from feeling incompatible with each other. Everything is OK, with the distinct sting of feeling like they could have been great, given the right conditions.                            
95	                                WRC 10 is absolutely amazing! The biggest downside is the learning curve, but the effort is well worth it when you take the time to master its handling. You can choose your tires and their position to suit the track and or your driving style and well as choose between auto and custom settings of the braking, suspension and other fine tuning. The amount of customization that is available for the player makes WRC 10 easy to get into regardless of your skill. Now we just need the ability to use a steering wheel instead of a controller and this would be an even better simulator.                            
90	                                Overall and if you can look past that glaring miss of possible greed, WRC 10 is a fantastic game. The cars feel the part, handling is much more in-depth this year than in previous entries, and should you have the capacity to race with a wheel then you’ll find the whole experience incredibly engaging. Even with a controller though there is certainly plenty to be excited by and whilst we only have a few years left of Kylotonn holding the WRC license, we are surely seeing the best we’ve ever seen from the franchise yet.                            
90	                                WRC 10 manages to rise definitively as the most complete rally title of the moment.                            
86	                                WRC 10 is postulated as one of the most complete iteration of the saga, with an extensive proposal for a single player with a wide career mode and a fun range of multiplayer mode. All this accompanied with a good visual appearance and good control that will make us feel the track at all times.                             
80	                                More of the same, with a classic touch to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of its sport, WRC 10 does what it needs to do. It’s a good game, that will keep fans playing for a long time to come.                             
80	                                Dodgy menu system and an online community which is lacking numbers aside, should you be after a deep, highly detailed rally racer, WRC 10 is going to cover everything you want and need… and then some.                            
80	                                It's a big yes and a very beautiful candle blown out by Kylotonn. If it does not upset the regulars, WRC 10 manages to advance all of its game modes with small nice touches, such as tire allocation management, new career roles or the livery editor. . Anniversary Mode galvanizes content and lifespan via new, delightfully old-school layouts, to make the title the most complete in the license. We take real pleasure in terms of racing sensations and a total change of scenery on some specials, despite the recurring lack of staging and some technical flaws (tearing, cliping ...). But that is not the important thing: WRC 10 ends a decade at the top of the slope masterfully climbed by Kylotonn in recent seasons, and we hope that the French studio will succeed in closing its commitment to the world rally championship in the best possible way next season.                             
80	                                While not a monumental upgrade over past installments, WRC 10 makes some welcome changes to the formula that continue to make it a must-play for fans of the sport.                            
80	                                WRC 10 is a great rally game and a lovely, if a fraction flawed, ode to the… 49-year history of the World Rally Championship. The end result isn’t streets ahead of the already impressive WRC 9 – and it’s still making some of the latter’s minor mistakes – but WRC 10 is another successful example of KT Racing’s commitment to fantastic stage design and frantic, fast-paced, and occasionally unforgiving fun.                            
75	                                WRC 10 is a game where fans will notice the tweaks and additions, while casual fans will ask why upgrade? This is common among games that focus on specific sports and genres. There is enough here though for diehards to consider upgrading. I am not thrilled that some of the interesting content is locked behind DLC, but even with that hangup the tweaks and additions make this version a worthy successor. This entry won’t change anyone’s opinion of the realistic rally genre, but for those that enjoy it, there are few better options on the market.                            
70	                                Quotation forthcoming.                            
60	                                There’s a lot going for WRC10. It’s slick, in-depth and full of authenticity. That’ll appeal to fans of the genre who want to go deep into the endless tweaks and changes available. But it isn’t the best driving game out there and ultimately, that’s what holds this back from being a classic racer.                            
75	                                Snails may be soft and slimy, but Clid is one tough mollusk. With an engaging narrative brimming with unexpected twists, Clid The Snail successfully delivers a mayhem-filled adventure and tells a story where you can clearly see the character’s development and motivation. Unfortunately, the core gameplay mechanics contain questionable design choices with the unnatural difficulty curve and lack of I-frames, making the game more frustrating than fun. Perhaps Clid could take some advice from Pythagoras or Euler in his next adventure. Until then, I still have some calculus homework I need to finish.                            
70	                                Clid The Snail has been a real surprise for me. It is impossible to overlook the incredible work that Weird Beluga Studio has done, the care and dedication they have put into every aspect of the game. They have built a very beautiful and detailed world, despite the fact that we spend 90% of the time shooting and looking at enemies. The story features original characters and dialogue that will bring a smile to our faces. And the gameplay is diabolical: I haven't had this much fun shooting things since 2016's DOOM and I haven't felt so on the ropes since Dark Souls and Bloodborne.                            
66	                                Unfortunately, the promising Clid The Snail fails to fully reach its potential and turns out to be a rather average game, held back by inexperience and, probably, the team's budget. Despite this, it's a great starting point for what we hope will be a long and prolific career for Weird Beluga.                            
65	                                Clid the Snail somehow manages to shoulder a cumbersome load of gameplay issues; opting to carry your attention with a unique cast of characters that tell an interesting story within a world that commands your interest.                            
63	                                Clid the Snail is a very appreciable twin-stick shooter from an artistic point of view, but which proves not to have equally solid gameplay due to some game design choices that enlighten the inexperience of the Spanish developers of Weird Beluga.                            
60	                                There’s a lot to like in Clid the Snail. The world itself is the main draw. It’s a wonderfully grim and strange apocalyptic setting full of interesting characters, history, and sights. When it works, the gunplay is strategic and entertaining, but too often it just never gels right leading to frustrating difficulty spikes and control issues.                            
60	                                Clid the Snail is a lot of really interesting ideas executed in a way that feels really rough around the edges. It’s almost there in many ways, but some quality of life issues and design choices hold back the unique concept. Its brilliant art and character design is masked by some hazy aesthetic choices. Its “methodical” combat often ends up more cumbersome and overwhelming than tactical. An interesting story, world, and mystery, however, helped to keep my interest despite these issues. If you love taking a chance on weird ideas—and that key art of Clid with his gun caught your attention—it’s worth experiencing Clid’s world, but be prepared for a number of speedbumps along the way.                            
55	                                Despite some good ideas and a rather promising narrative, Clid the Snail suffers from a highly repetitive level design and visuals as foggy as they are crippling. Finally if the arsenal and the range of enemies are fairly well found, the execution is too frustrating and leads to a very average experience, perfectible in many aspects.                            
50	                                It’s unfortunate that Clid the Snail is so boring to play, because it really has some interesting ingredients. Between the oddball premise and the unsettling atmosphere, there’s definitely some talent here. Ultimately though, none of that can overcome gameplay that just falls a little flat.                            
50	                                Clid the Snail is a passable twin-stick shooter with plenty of basic plot to keep you on your slimy path. But it is very rough round the edges. Simplistic combat, dated level design and a grimdark colour palette make it a little hard to see, let alone care what’s going on.                            
50	                                The moments when Clid the Snail are at its best are few and far between. Decent dialogue and a basic but satisfying story can’t make up for the shallow level design, dumb enemy AI, and aggravating encounters. Even its strong points, like its varied weapon selection and a unique take on the post-apocalypse, feel hampered by the lack of firepower and poor coloring and ugly camera filter, respectively. If you’re a twin-stick shooter junkie looking for a new fix, this one isn’t worth leaving your shell for.                            
100	                                Forza Horizon 5 is a masterclass example of how to do an open-world racing game, bar none. Thanks to its deeply rich map, wealth of content, and fantastic visuals, it's the best racing experience I've had yet.                            
95	                                Forza Horizon 5 is the racing game for everyone, which takes outsiders from the racing genre and turns them into followers of the speed, and for those who are already fans, it offers an almost endless variety of activities and challenges. Also very remarkable is the representation of Mexico, which offers vibrant landscapes full of incredible details that only those who live in Mexico will recognize. It is an indispensable game and highly recommended.                            
95	                                Forza Horizon 5 is built to deliver hour after hour of glossy, beautiful fun. Hit the race mechanics as deeply as you like. Zip around the amazingly beautiful map in a Corvette for no reason at all. Find secrets. Build out your car collection. Get rich. Have a good time the way you want. Go anywhere, do anything, just don’t skip this stellar game.                            
95	                                Forza Horizon 5 is yet another step up for the series and arguably the best racing game ever made. Offering a host of content across a fantastic representation of Mexico, its varied terrain and scenery, there's so much to explore and race. A massive roster of cars will perform all of these, each feeling different from the others, with a variety of upgrade and tuning options almost matching those of simulation titles. While there are a few minor niggles here and there, they are nearly so small as to be hardly worth mentioning. All in all, it's impossible not to recommend this for anybody, regardless of them being a fan of racing games or not, as this is that good.                            
95	                                ¡Ay, caramba! Forza Horizon 5 is maturing under the Mexican sun a recipe concocted by Playground Games that has already delighted millions of pilots. Like an antojito, Forza Horizon 5 can be enjoyed in a good mood with anyone, anytime. Rolling over everything that has already been technically done and taking advantage of the Xbox Series X springboard to stamp the skies, Microsoft's software climbs the volcano of fun and unleashes an exhilarating torrent to be experienced alone or with others. It’s the festival of the decade.                             
91	                                I don't think there's a motoring enthusiast who won't be excited about Forza Horizon 5, with a slight caveat for those who have had their fill of Forza Horizon 4 and might want more of the same - though honestly, I can't imagine how the formula could be improved upon, which in the arcade driving department is bordering on perfection. It promises and delivers an incomparably customizable driving experience, with dream-cars, in breathtaking landscapes.                            
90	                                A masterful open-world racer in an unforgettable setting - would havebenefited from a little more courage to innovate.                            
90	                                It’s no surprise that Forza Horizon puts itself right into the mix with 2021’s Game of the Year contenders. Playground Games has been getting it right for a decade now. This is the definitive experience in the series so far, one that excels both on PC and the Xbox Series X. Minimal issues, such as server connectivity, fail to spoil the party that is just crammed with happiness and adventure. A number of small improvements across the board elevates the racer to being best in class; a huge plus for Microsoft with Sony’s impressive-looking Gran Turismo 7 flashing its headlights not too far in the distance.                            
90	                                Familiar, excellent, and polished to a degree that hardly seems possible. If you love taking vintage Porsches for joyrides through environments that’d have a poet bawling then you're going to be very happy here.                            
90	                                Forza Horizon 5 is a formidable game, with a spectacular graphics and an overwhelming amount of content. But above all, it is a fun title that dignifies the fun in video games with no greater pretension than that, to have the best time possible.                            
90	                                Forza Horizon 5 is undoubtedly a visual showcase and technical benchmark for PC and Xbox Series X owners. If you have the hardware to run this game on PC, this is the choice to make.                            
90	                                You can whine about the lack of revolution, but when everything works perfectly fine, maybe there is no reason to change it. Forza Horizon 5 is definitely the best racing game out there and has no competition. This is, by far, the biggest car adventure you can have on your screen.                            
90	                                Playground's singular series gets a lush new setting, but otherwise remains committed to tuning an already winning formula. But even a marginal improvement on the best racing series around is worth celebrating.                            
90	                                While Forza Horizon 5 launches with a score of "only" 9.0, it has potential for even more. All Playground Games have to do is to eliminate bugs and bring back some missing cars, which could be done in a few months, with several updates. What about a perfect 10/10? It would require a multitude of further improvements to AI and physics. But perhaps Forza Horizon 6 will achieve that. I surely hope so, as this would give us the perfect racing game.                            
90	                                With Forza Horizon 5, the racing series makes its first stop in Mexico. It delivers breathtaking vistas, fast action, and the hook: the new EventLab mode that lets the community create cool, custom challenges.                            
90	                                The detour into Mexico is a sight for sore eyes after a three-year stay in the rather dreary United Kingdom of Horizon 4. Innovation is about the last thing you’ll find on the Forza Horizon 5 buffet, but there is no denying that this is the best software available for Microsoft’s Series X|S consoles and, for people who have strong PCs, the best reason yet to pony up for a 4K 120Hz HDR display.                            
85	                                Forza Horizon 5 is still an incredible racing game, one only overshadowed by the brilliance of its predecessor. Those with a lot of time behind the wheel in Forza Horizon 4 may feel this is one step forward for two steps back, but there's still a ton of fun to be had in this high-octane adventure.                            
85	                                Forza Horizon 5 has carried the tradition of consuming my time inside a genre that normally doesn't interest me. Playground Games has displayed technical wizardry with this game and while it doesn’t change the formula to any significant extent, the experience found within Forza Horizon 5 is killer.                            
92	                                Overall, Riders Republic is a fantastic game and the most addictive extreme sports game on the market outside of maybe the Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 and 2 remake. The variety of sports enables the experience to remain fresh, while those wanting a greater challenge can enjoy more events faster by stepping their game up and going for a more all-encompassing experience with more tricks and tougher difficulty. Cross-generation buyers will be in for a far better experience on the PS5 thanks to the SSD speeding things up and making for a much smoother experience, but the PS4 version is impressive given the tech. If it wasn’t for the SSD’s speed, the feeling of both versions’ races would be quite similar and you can’t go wrong with any version.                            
91	                                Riders Republic definitely does check most of the boxes for what I would like to see in an open world extreme sports title. My only real criticism is that with all the variety of sports, events, equipment and environments, it still starts to feel a bit repetitive after reaching a certain level. The Big/Boss and Sponsor events help to overcome that to an extent and I’m hoping the addition of new sports, fresh live events, and themed seasonal/limited events will as well when they roll out in the future. For now, Riders Republic is a super fun pick up and play multiplayer outdoor sports experience with plenty to see and do right out of the box.                            
90	                                Riders Republic is an extremely fun game that will definitely please the fans of this sports. And even as a casual gamer, this title offers plenty of accessibility options that make it a very welcoming experience for newcomers.                             
88	                                Riders Republic can be a ton of colorful fun, with go-anywhere do-anything extreme sports gameplay that is instantly accessible and appealing, all wrapped up in a tortilla of weird goofiness. Engage with the stuff you like, ignore the stuff you don't, and get penalized for absolutely nothing. Riders Republic is most concerned with letting the good times roll—and for the most part, it succeeds admirably.                            
85	                                Riders Republic is a truly massive extreme sports game that borrows from Ubisoft's better open world pillars. A variety of events and the ability to play against massive servers in a gorgeous sandbox provide a unique thrill that few games manage.                            
85	                                Riders Republic is a worthy successor to both Steep and The Crew. This massive multiplayer sports game offers access to a beautiful area where players can go all out and hardly be put in the way.                            
85	                                Riders Republic is at its core a fun game that only wants you to have fun, more than most games. Its UI isn't the best, and there still seem to be some bugs that need to be ironed out, but there are no issues that really break your fun along the way. On top of the gorgeous presentation, Riders Republic is easy to recommend for anyone with a liking towards a game where they can flip around three times on a pair of rocket ski's mid-air while dressed as a giraffe.                            
85	                                Riders Republic’s posturing is more than a little phony and the game may be a bit mechanically simple for some, but its playground is an impressive one. With travel still difficult, Ubisoft’s sometimes-breathtaking recreation of America’s greatest national parks feels like something to be grateful for, and this game’s wide range of activities and challenges means almost everyone will be able to find some way to amuse themselves amongst its peaks and valleys. Riders Republic is a surprising breath of virtual fresh air.                            
85	                                No matter what you have your sights set on, be it a casual, aimless session with friends, or a dedicated grind through a mapped-out campaign, Rider's Republic is just a blast. Ubisoft’s new action sports game is the most thrilling the genre has seen in years and we don’t see Riders Republic pumping the brakes anytime soon.                            
83	                                Riders Republic is a little surprise, an extreme sports game that pick ups elements from the legends of the genre and applies them to a huge open world, more social-oriented, but without losing the focus on the fun part. It's far from perfect, but at least tries to do something different... despite the micropayments.                            
81	                                If you can ignore the game’s obnoxious attitude and in your face corporate sponsorship, you’re richly rewarded with accessible, consistently engaging representations of biking, snow sports, and wing suiting, coupled with a massive and literally awesome environment in which to compete or explore. Those that are into riding the leaderboards–or just playing with their friends–will have plenty of opportunities to fuel their addiction, but I’m guessing that just about everyone can find joy here in just goofing around in this expansive playground, at least for a while. Whether or not Riders Republic sticks the landing and stays in the playlist of many gamers beyond launch probably depends on a steady stream of new sports to try, and if an actual, thriving community pledges allegiance to the Republic’s competitive modes.                            
80	                                Despite having to endure a small yet annoying cast of characters, and the usual performance weirdness inherent in open worlds, Riders Republic is a huge step up from Steep. Newcomers can slowly develop their skills, focus on being creative, or just enjoy some of the most incredible places on earth. The truly competitive can get knocked around in Mass Races or replay events for every last star. It’s an inviting world that’s packed with crazy competitors and an addictive series of trials to master.                            
80	                                Focusing on having fun above all else, Riders Republic’s excellent open world, great disciplines and a huge amount of variation will keep you shredding snow and blasting through berms for a long time.                            
80	                                It does have some shortcomings: Namely its dialogue and slightly self-conscious microtransaction system. But when it’s on-form, it’s a lot of fun. If you have any taste for these kinds of extreme sports titles, then you’ll likely enjoy Riders Republic.                            
80	                                Riders Republic is a step in the right direction for open-world games. It fills the void for extreme sports games in an industry mostly filled with narrative or combat-driven projects. From the sprawling mountains of Bryce Canyon to the luscious forests of Yosemite, there’s always something beautiful to see and exciting to do. Ubisoft crafted a brilliant social, digital atmosphere that makes you feel like you’re actually participating in the Rider’s Ridge Invitational. See you on the slopes, kid.                            
80	                                If you like the idea of thrill-seeking but you’d rather do it from the comfort of your living room, Riders Republic should be right up your street. This is pure entertainment at its finest; a game that’s all about having fun, living in the moment, and not taking life seriously. Play it straight and try to win every race if you want. Or simply speed around dressed in an inflatable giraffe costume. It’s your choice, and that in itself is the beauty of Riders Republic.                            
80	                                Riders Republic is as crazy as much as it is fun and enjoyable: a game you cannot break away from.                            
80	                                Quotation forthcoming.                            
80	                                Riders Republic is on balance a Steep on steroids. The latest effort of Ubisoft Annecy is a huge playground available to the player and in which it is possible to have fun both in a carefree and in a more serious way thanks to the total freedom of approach and the countless customizations of the control system. If you are willing to overcome a few minor gameplay problems for certain types of activities, which would need some extra filing, and some technical fluctuations, Riders Republic will be able to offer you an unprecedented amount of hours of fun, thank you. also to the intention of the developers to support the product both through paid updates and new completely free content.                             
80	                                Riders Republic comes with a lot to give, and one might argue that it may give too much. The Ranking and Item Unlocking systems distract from an experience that, at its core, gives us the best radical sports game since the SSX franchise. Ubisoft presented us with one of the most earnestly fun titles of the year, despite some unfortunately typical choice from the company. The biome diversity and the sheer amount of events, with Mass Races being the standout, culminate in one of the most pleasant gameplays in this genre.                            
80	                                If you can get past all the posturing and over-the-top woo-hooing, Riders Republic is a very good extreme sports game.                            
80	                                Riders Republic makes a strong case as one of the best and most varied extreme sports games to date, with a solid offering of unique vehicles that are fun to use and master. The expansive open world and huge number of events will ensure that players could spend countless hours completing every challenge and finding every secret, all on top of the exciting multiplayer options. There’s still technical issues to iron out, but whether you want the chaotic thrills of Mass Races or the chilling exploration of Zen mode, the accessible and deep nature of Riders Republic makes it a must-play for racing fans of any skill level.                            
80	                                Riders Republic makes the best use of Ubisoft’s open-world template. It’s a consistently fun extreme sports game with tons of variety, a wealth of challenges to chase, and excellent social hooks. All of its sporting events are easy to pick up and play, making it perfectly suited for quick drop-ins. Its sense of style is a little out of whack and it doesn’t have the most elegant camera solution, but I’m always eager to fire it up and see how much more it can one-up its zaniness.                            
80	                                Riders Republic is an incredibly fun game that's held back by its controls and the Ubisoft fanfare of microtransactions and content bloating. These issues can be fixed though and with players already being turned off by these issues, Ubisoft will likely take steps to address them - even if it's just tightening up the controls. Though Riders Republic is a thoroughly good time, some players will rightfully feel that its current issues may not justify the price tag.                            
80	                                Once you get through the tutorial, Riders Republic opens up into a sandbox only limited by your imagination. There’s enough to do to keep players busy for a long time and enough variety to keep things fresh. So grab your board, hop on your bike, it’s time to ride.                            
80	                                Riders Republic is exactly the game it is trying to be, with a modern take on early 2000s xtreme sports games that works in terms of everything except the corporate-mandated ambience.                            
78	                                Arcadic extreme sports game with a focus on multiplayer events that gives sports fans exactly what it should: fun in competition with over-the-top tricks.                            
77	                                Riders Republic is the ultimate extreme sports collectible pack. The sense of speed will keep you on the edge of your seat and the varied controls of the different disciplines will challenge you long enough. A footnote is that you should be able to entertain yourself a bit in the graphically beautiful world of Riders Republic, because just like with Steep, the flow of the game is not very obvious. Oh, and give more Mass Races.                            
75	                                The focus on open-world gameplay was a blessing and a curse for Rider's Republic. It's still a good game, sure - but a little more focus of Ubisoft's side, and it could have become something truly special.                            
75	                                The story is lackluster, the microtransactions are everywhere, but everything else is amazing; it's like being on a rollercoaster ride every single second you play. Ubisoft put its heart and soul into developing every location just so that each race and each moment feels immensely different from the next. It's an absolutely thrilling, immersive experience that does well to keep you entertained for hours and hours on end. If only you could spend more time racing people instead of bots, then it'd really feel like you're working to become the amazing triathlete Riders Republic wants you to be.                            
75	                                Riders Republic is a bit like Forza Horizon by bike, ski, wingsuit… and less successful, we're not going to lie to each other! The game is far from bad, but its "cringe" dialogues, the endless Ubisoftian micro-transactions, and its sometimes surprising physique prevent it from really reaching new heights.                            
75	                                If Riders Republic may disappoint Steep fans (the title goes against the spirit of the game of 2016), this new production remains a must for all thrill seekers. With its many playable sports disciplines, starting with the bike which offers exhilarating sensations, its exotic world and its many modes available both solo and online, the latest production from Ubisoft Annecy will undoubtedly keep you busy for the long haul.                             
75	                                It’s not every day that we get an extreme sports game, particularly one on this scale.                            
70	                                Variety, competition, and awful writing are at the heart of this enjoyable open-world racer. The rough edges are forgivable thanks to all the good old-fashioned fun. [Issue#8, p.88]                            
70	                                Riders Republic, like Steep, is at its best when the game forces you to try harder. Mastering certain challenges takes practice and patience. That's what makes the game. Like Steep, Riders Republic doesn't have a storyline, fancy style, important dialogue, or great music. Riders Republic is just a beautiful game world where you take on breakneck challenges. That turns out to be enough.                             
70	                                It's not the prettiest game, with distant scenery lacking detail, low-res cinematics, and screen tearing in busy areas. But the dizzying scale of the world, and the complete lack of loading times, is technically impressive. It's also worth noting that you need to be online to experience the career mode and progression—otherwise you're stuck with the freeform, rather empty Zen Mode. Most people play games online these days, but if you can't for whatever reason, your options will be limited. It's frustrating, because the actual riding in Riders Republic is heaps of fun. It's just been packaged in a completely off-putting way. You'll have to decide if the cringe is worth putting up with.                             
70	                                Riders Republic tries so hard to be cool that it deserves a roundhouse kick to the mouth, but Ubisoft’s technical chops come out to play here, with an enormous online sandbox stacked to the metaphorical ceiling with high-octane events to complete. This is a game that the French publisher has clearly designed to be built upon, but even day one, with its mix of disciplines and multifaceted Mass Races, it’s an entertaining ride. There are minor niggles for the French publisher to iron out, and we’d recommend muting the dialogue, but don’t bail on this if you have even a passing interest in extreme sports.                            
68	                                Even though I liked the racing in Riders Republic, overall, I can't say I enjoyed my time with it. It's a missed opportunity of a game, focusing on all the wrong things, making for an experience worth skipping.                            
65	                                The Considering that Riders Republic is not a sports simulation and only aims to offer fun and excitement, and even though there are a lot of problems that cannot be looked over and some of them directly affect the gameplay experience, the final package can still be entertaining while you jump on different vehicles and race around the big, crowded and colorful world of the game.                            
65	                                Riders Republic is a step forward in Ubisoft's sporting open worlds, but we're still far from the best that this sport subgenre can really offer.                            
65	                                While it has promise, Riders Republic feels like it needs a bit more time in the oven. For fans of extreme sports, there’s certainly something to enjoy here – just don’t be surprised when a variety of issues run the experience into the ground.                            
60	                                Riders Republic brings some extreme sports fun to the table that is enjoyable for a long time coming. The diverse disciplines makes it variable enough to keep engaged. However, Riders Republic suffers from technical issues. Crashes aren't uncommon, the game knows a lot of bugs and issues and also the camera can be annoying from time to time. It's a fun game, but it could've been a lot better on the technical side.                            
60	                                Riders Republic is a game players can effortlessly lose themselves in, even if the gameplay itself is pretty shallow. The endless barrage of events populating the world map become less exciting over time, resembling a shopping list rather than milestones in your ascension to extreme sports godhood. If you’re still keen to take the plunge, make sure you have a posse ready to party up with.                             
60	                                Riders Republic is a buffet of breathtaking sights and catchy sounds, but it’s bogged down by checklists and grinds.                            
85	                                Crysis Remastered Trilogy offers a memorable single-player FPS experience that every fan of the genre should play. Although modern gamers may only recognize the name from a meme shared by older PC nerds, it gives everyone a chance to play these games on modern hardware with optimized visuals. I feel like this was a needed release from developer Crytek. I hope they can muster up a follow-up that retains this single-player experience because this gaming generation needs it.                            
82	                                The Crysis Remastered Trilogy gives new life to three outstanding shooters of the recent past.                            
80	                                The three Crysis games still look great on modern PCs and are a lot fun, which raises the question if we really needed these remasters in the first place. The first Crysis Remastered is somewhat of a mixed bag, in some regards better, in others subpar to the amazing PC original. Crysis 2 however looks noticably crisper with some nice visual touches like raytraced reflections, sharper textures and improved lighting. The third remaster received less attention in comparison, up to a point where one might ask if a simple patch would have sufficed. Which brings us to the consoles, because this is where the three remasters really shine: No matter on which plattform you play, the console versions are greatly improved with smoother framerates and sharper image quality that outshines the original Xbox 360 and PS3 releases in every possible way.                            
80	                                Some movies work better in theaters. Some games work better on bleeding-edge hardware. The stars have aligned and a premium Crysis experience is available for the masses. There’s never been a better time to put on the NanoSuit than right now.                            
80	                                Quotation forthcoming.                            
80	                                Crysis Remastered Trilogy is an excellent collection as a whole, which allows you to play the three chapters that make up the series with more modern graphics, capable of taking advantage of even the most performing video cards. Of course, it is interesting to note how you start with an excellent title (Crysis), moving on to a decent one and nothing more (Crysis 2) to get to a really great one (Crysis 3), but honestly we do not recommend you to sacrifice any of the three (they are can also be purchased individually) in case you decide to take the trilogy, because in any case they form a unique story, which is worth living in full, once you are inside. It must also be said that the experience as a whole remains identical to that of the originals, so those who have already lived it will not find great incentives to do it again, apart from the graphic ones.                            
75	                                Crytek has really worked hard to enhance the graphical experience of the various games, especially on PCs where the Windows version can rely on a few features, such as ray-tracing, which give a real boost. The environments are drastically improved and despite the sometimes difficult optimization, the rendering is very good. As for the Crysis themselves, it is clear that a number of mechanisms are now aging: they remain good titles, but never speak of excellence ... It's up to you to see what you are looking for.                            
75	                                The work done on Crysis 2 and 3 makes the Crysis Remastered Trilogy a better proposition than the first game alone. The more stable frame rate and presence of DLSS right out of the box provides a much better first impression compared to the unstable frame rate of the first game; the ray tracing is equally impressive yet flawed. The gunplay feels tighter in these entries, but newcomers may be more disappointed in seeing how the game constrains itself with each subsequent entry. There's still room for improvement, but the whole thing feels like a safer purchase for those who want to experience some good games with minor updates.                            
70	                                Crysis Remastered Trilogy is a collection of games that is a hell of a lot of fun and really is an important moment in video game history. For a while there, it was the benchmark for graphics in games, and it’s important that games like this are preserved and released in their remastered form not just on PC but for modern consoles as well. It’s a bundle for those who love their games to look gorgeous, have the autonomy to blow up stuff in a number of different and creative ways, and love FPS vibes. With all three games remastered and in one collection, Crysis Remastered Trilogy is a lot of big bangs for your buck, despite some shortfalls.                            
80	                                Hell Let Loose is one of the best WWII shooters, certainly not suitable for everyone due to his hardcore gameplay but still rewarding if played with the right collaborative spirit.                            
75	                                Hell Let Loose can often feel slow-paced and tedious, but if you’re a strategic thinker looking for rewarding and realistic gameplay, then this could be the game for you.                            
73	                                Caveats noted, playing Hell Let Loose with a decent squad of players willing to communicate, a competent commander, and skills sufficient to the moment is a unique, exciting, and extremely rewarding first-person shooter experience, ultimately much more satisfying than the arcade shooters to which most players are accustomed. Getting to the point of real comfort with the game’s mechanics, interface and team systems takes a commitment of time and the willingness to learn from others and the game’s written material, and is definitely not for everyone. Hell Let Loose does a great job of reminding us how important teamwork, communication, and reliance on others can be, not just in war but maybe in the broader context of our lives.                            
72	                                Quotation forthcoming.                            
70	                                Hell Let Loose does little to overcome the downsides of its realistic take on World War 2 and strategic gameplay, but manages to reap some rewards out of it as well.                            
70	                                The experience of playing Hell Let Loose is largely dependent on the player. People new to the genre, especially those playing solo, may be inclined to abandon the game entirely after just a few hours, and I wouldn’t blame them. But Milsim veterans, and players who stick around long enough to learn the ropes and find a squad, will find a deep and rewarding experience in this WWI shooter.                             
70	                                Hell Let Loose could become a real hit amongst those looking for a bit more of a grounded experience than Call of Duty or Battlefield. However, the experience will rely heavily on the community engaging with each other positively to put plans together and make the experience authentic. Hell Let Loose is a game about teamwork and without it the chaos of war will overwhelm a player.                            
50	                                The premise (a WW2 FPS with an interest in realism and a limited HUD) is sound. But snipers have an unreasonable advantage over every other unit, and while communication is important to the experience, there’s no decent alternative to voice chat (which almost nobody uses). For a large-scale WW2 shooter, try Enlisted instead – it’s more fun and is free to play. [Issue#8, p.97]                            
80	                                The AI bots are dumb, but it’s really in the local play and online where the game shines. It’s fast, fun and furious, with a pace that makes the older gamer wince, but when it all comes together, Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl is more than capable of delivering a decent old time.                              
80	                                A game with a boat load of Nostalgia and good bones. A fighter that’s fun with friends, challenging with AI, and competitive online. With time and love, Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl could be a top tier fighter in the near future.                            
78	                                Brawl it out as your favorite Nickelodeon characters in bombastic platform battles! With a power-packed cast of heroes from the Nickelodeon Channel.                            
73	                                Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl tries to be a challenger for Super Smash Bros. and aims for the weak spot of his opponent, showing off a stable and solid netcode. A good multiplayer and tight controls, though, are not enough to reach the stars. The roster is good and varied, but a little scarce right now (maybe DLCs will fill the gap) and characters lack characterization (no pun intended): a pity, because Nickelodeon’s original voices and music would have added a lot of value to the game.                             
70	                                Nostalgia fills the air in Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl now that it is out on Xbox. On one hand this is the closest the Xbox will see to Super Smash Bros. and on the other hand it’s full of classic Nickelodeon cartoons and I love a good crossover. This will no doubt be a fun time with friends or kids alike as long as you know that the base content can be had very quickly and thus the repeatability could become a bore. If you are in it for the long time this is a fine brawler to pick up.                            
70	                                Probably the most fun you can have in a Nickelodeon videogame, this is a derivative but fun fighter that kids will enjoy, but will probably do quite well in the competitive community too.                            
70	                                Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl is a fun fighting game with iconic characters and easy to learn but challenging to master mechanics. They nailed the feel of a good fighting game, but the game still feels like it has a ways to go before it reaches the level of an iconic franchise like Smash. The potential is absolutely there, and after we see a few DLC launches who knows where it will stand, but for now it’s hard to imagine myself inviting friends over to play All-Star Brawl when Super Smash Bros. Ultimate is still around.                            
70	                                Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl contains the beginnings of what may end up being the most unlikely competitive fighting franchise ever conceived. It knows its audience and it has been able to appease them, garnering a lot of excitement along the way. However, where Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl missteps is in the handling of its properties. It's easy to get excited about the thought of Reptar dash-dancing across Jellyfish Fields, but it's tough to buy into the idea when there's a rogue ukulele serenading the mute dinosaur while it happens.                            
70	                                Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl is riddled with flaws. Not very pretty, not always very precise, a little sparse in content, the dubbing of the original cartoons are absent ... However, the fighting game of Fair Play Labs exudes passion. We don't recommend it to everyone, as NASB is targeting a very specific niche. By mimicking the physics of Super Smash Bros. Melee and implementing one of its advanced techniques, this atypical brawler manages to seduce those nostalgic for the early 2000s. Those will see it as a good way to immerse themselves in the licenses of their childhood while by rediscovering familiar sensations and a solid competitive environment. Hopefully the studio's follow-up will be good, as Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl is holding something.                             
70	                                Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl is brimming with fantastic characters, fun combat, and legitimate potential. However, limited content and a laundry list of bugs keep it from thriving as a platform fighter right now.                            
65	                                Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl is a platform fighting game that offers fun and good times with friends. Evaluated from this perspective, the game delivers, and if that's what you're looking for, you won't regret it. However, this game could have been much better, especially in details, fluidity and content. If you are able to look past its disappointing visuals, or its unoriginal soundtrack, this game might have something interesting to give you.                             
50	                                There's also just not enough content to sink your teeth into. Outside of arcade, multiplayer and a sports mode, where players must score a goal in the opponent's goal, there's just not much to do. Unlocks aren't particularly exciting either, offering little more than concept art and other goodies. It's all a bit of a shame, as there's honestly some solid mechanics buried beneath the issues. If developers Ludosity and Fair Play Labs can stick with the game post-launch and build it up, it could end up being a completely different story in a year or so, but as it stands, Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl feels like the shell of what it could be.                            
90	                                The Medium on PS5 is as good as it was on Xbox Series X, however, with DualSense support it becomes a much more immersive game.                            
90	                                The game's arrival on the PlayStation 5 has been a long time coming. But thankfully, it was well worth the wait. With its unique dual-world gameplay mechanics and gripping narrative, The Medium is yet another macabre masterpiece from the talent at Bloober Team. If you have even a passing interest in horror games or are looking for a powerful supernatural story to experience that isn't afraid to touch on sensitive subjects, this is one game that demands a spot in your PS5 library.                            
85	                                The Medium proves to be an interesting look into the human psyche, one that attempts to figure out why individuals are the way they are, while still stating that your past does not excuse your current actions. I greatly enjoyed my time in Marianne’s shoes, and found myself constantly impressed with the incredible graphics and unique mechanics. Bloober Team has made an impressive product, even more so on the PS5 with their willingness to make use of the PS5’s controller’s special features.                            
84	                                The Medium on PS5 is pretty much as good as it was on Xbox Series X, despite some graphic flaws and loading issues. Luckily, the DualSense features manage to fill the gap.                            
80	                                The Medium on PlayStation 5 feels like the best version of the game and one worth trying if you have yet to experience it elsewhere. While its unique dual-reality perspective lifted the game up, players expecting an outrageously different spin on psychological horror may have seen these scares before. But it’s hard to deny that Blooper Team aimed for the fences with The Medium and payed homage to the classics while crafting a new universe that they may wish to refine further down the line.                            
80	                                The Medium tells an interesting paranormal story and allows you to explore an environment that’s as creepy as it is fascinating. On top of that, it looks and sounds great. However, you’ll have to endure the sometimes clunky camera angles.                            
80	                                Bloober Team meshes all of these elements together to draw players further into The Medium's world than the Xbox/PC versions were capable of, elevating an already enjoyable experience to new heights. It stands to reason that the PS5 version of The Medium is the ideal way to experience Marianne's dual-reality adventures, and PlayStation 5 owners that enjoy horror games should definitely check the game out.                            
80	                                Now on PS5, The Medium is the same game players could have experienced on Xbox and PC. A strong narrative and the concept of twin worlds make it a pleasure to discover, even if it feels a bit simplistic. DualSense make it a little bit more immersive, even though technical hiccups can be a bit frustrating.                             
80	                                The Medium surprised me with its psychologically twisted, complex and intricate story that had me enthralled from the moment the intrigue turned into something more sinister and personable. Even with its simplistic gameplay design and clunky encounter mechanics, the atmosphere of the world and enjoyable tale should carry you through even its darkest corners. In the real world, The Medium would be basic, but in the spirit realm, it comes to life and will show you the disturbing but enchanting fabric of its reality.                            
80	                                It could very well be the best psychological horror experience on the console.                            
78	                                The Medium lands on PlayStation 5 after seven months after its launch on Xbox and PC ready to take advantage of all the technology of the new Sony console to bring its peculiarities to this horror adventure that will keep you at the controls for a good handful of hours.                            
77	                                With each game they release, Bloober Team continues to make strides, and The Medium is another such step. It has an intriguing story with intriguing characters. The game also has a nifty mix of old and new gameplaying elements.                            
77	                                This is the same experience that we know, now with a correct implementation of the DualSense that doesn’t really add anything too exciting.                            
77	                                Bloober Team is no stranger to making games that feature concepts with immense potential, like Blair Witch or Observer. The Medium is probably my favorite of theirs to date. It's got a couple of warts, but it's easy to get lost in its world (both of them), even with its pitch-black narrative overtones. It makes it feel important, though perhaps not something you'll feel compelled to play on repeat.                            
75	                                The Medium is an admirable horror experience from a developer that has been making a lot of huge strides for itself in the world of horror game development. It’s not something that is going to change the world of horror games, but it does enough unique things with the simultaneous dual-world mechanic to stand out. Like many horror games before it, it fails to balance its tension with certain gameplay mechanics that can turn from fear to frustration pretty quickly, but these are spaced out enough that it never ruined the experience wholesale. For any horror fans looking for a Silent Hill-esque game to fill that ominous void, The Medium will at least scratch that itch.                            
72	                                The way that The Medium brings trauma to life in various ways is awe-inspiring. At the same time, it's not all that good of a video game.                            
70	                                All in all, The Medium is a good game, but not revolutionary and certainly not the new king of the genre. The story and atmosphere will stay with you long after finishing it, but the gameplay has a lot of room for improvement. If you prioritize a good story and a masterfully crafted atmosphere The Medium will not disappoint.                            
70	                                The Medium is a game with great potential and bad execution, as its issues and problems such as limited gameplay, easy puzzles and bad camera work eventually overtake its great story telling and engaging atmosphere.                            
70	                                This edition of The Medium is suitable for those who have not had, in the past, the chance of recovering the title in the Microsoft or PC ecosystem. This is perhaps not the best of the ports, but the new features related to DualSense and the generic good quality of the product can fully justify the purchase.                            
70	                                Also on PS5 The Medium confirms the strengths and weaknesses of a production that is at times also genuinely intriguing, but unable to distinguish itself and to sanction that consecration of the Polish studio that many would have expected (even more so with what seemed to be the project of maturity definitive). The experience is essentially identical to that which lived seven months ago on the Xbox Series X, with a big difference, indeed in practice two. Even without epochal revolutions, on PlayStation 5 the DualSense adds something in terms of interaction compared to the original version, but on the Microsoft console the inclusion of the game in the Game Pass catalog since day one weighs a lot: a download to The Medium yes can and if you are a fan of the genre you must give it without reservations, while the investment of 49.99 € must be taken less lightly.                             
65	                                Mechanically and in terms of storytelling you get the same experience on PS5 like on the other platforms. The newly added DualSense functionality feels out of place, though.                             
60	                                Despite some impressive DualSense implementation, the blemishes embedded into The Medium's gameplay and narrative still show on PS5. While The Medium is an intriguing horror game, it certainly isn't a great one.                             
60	                                With a story that’s just okay and controls that make you want to pull your hair out, the great audio and voice acting are overshadowed. Watching someone else play it would be the more satisfying route to experience The Medium.                            
60	                                The Medium is a linear experience with an interesting if underutilised split dimension mechanic. The story is complex but can also be predictable whilst not providing enough in the way of intrigue. Temper your expectations and you may just get something out of it.                            
60	                                The Medium shines when it’s letting you soak in its beautifully crafted dual worlds and melancholic soundtrack, but early promise of a quietly effective ghost story unravels as the story staggers clumsily to a point where it becomes almost unbearable in its attempt to tackle a tough subject.                            
90	                                Time Loader is a great game for just about anyone to play. As long as you're not expecting action-filled gameplay, but rather a relaxing journey, there is barely a reason not to give the game a shot.                            
90	                                Time Loader is a great physics-based puzzler with a ton of heart that grips you emotionally throughout and refuses to let go.                            
90	                                Even though the story serves as yet another example of why one shouldn’t trifle with time travel, the fun involved makes turning the clock back to 1995 seem pretty enticing. From solid physics to flawlessly detailed environments, Time Loader takes the player on a wild ride through the past and launches the neglected 2D puzzle-platformer genre into the future like a speeding DeLorean leaving flame trails in its wake.                            
85	                                Time Loader features a beautifully created complex world with a variety of well-constructed paths, puzzles and riddles presented to players from the point of view of a tiny robotic car. Even seemingly mundane things take on new interesting forms during the game. Seemingly trivial things can be used in creative ways during the playthrough and even force you to reconsider your attitude towards the surroundings and the story at large.                            
80	                                A well made game with a great premise and enjoyable elements, Time Loader is well worth a playthrough for fans of puzzle platformers.                            
70	                                Despite a few shortcomings, over the course of a playthrough, Time Loader proves itself to be a game worth trying out for those interested in its concept. The story is smart and, in true time travel fashion, has multiple ways in which it can come to a close. All of this is presented alongside a solid gameplay core which makes for a fun, if short, jaunt through a sci-fi tale.                            
50	                                Ultimately, Time Loader is a beautiful-looking, wonderful-sounding game, with some fun gameplay. It's let down by a story that focuses on a character without making them engaging, the lack of challenge that comes with the puzzles, and everything being in service of the game's least engaging aspect. It is unfortunately quite a short game as well. My initial run-through clocked in at about 2.6 hours. So a recommendation here is really based on what you want for your money. If you're fine with slightly un-challenging, hand-holdy at times gameplay and a story that looks pretty but doesn't go anywhere, pick it up! If you want a little more bang for your buck, maybe wait it out to see if Flazm adds anything interesting. Honestly, this game has a lot of potential to be good, if they just rework the story and maybe add some challenge levels.                             
90	                                Nostalgia and fond memories aside, Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania delivers an experience that’s always been amazing, and now it comes complete with a fresh coat of paint and a bunch of extras. To any one who hasn’t yet tried these titles, I say… Go bananas.                            
90	                                Banana Mania is the ultimate Super Monkey Ball collection: the best levels, the best minigames and the best fun. But don’t let the cute graphics lull you into a false sense of security, even with the questionable quality of life improvements, it remains as tricky and as addictive as ever.                            
90	                                All in all, it’s fantastic to see Super Monkey Ball back after all these years. This Banana Mania collection brings the classic games back to the fore, with hundreds of stages to play, a dozen mini games, lots of cosmetics to unlock and more. The gameplay is as challenging – and fun – as ever, and will no doubt garner a new audience of fans that still have youth on their side.                            
88	                                Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania brings the best of the franchise to a new generation. Same fun, only enhanced.                            
80	                                 Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania is undoubtedly a great way to celebrate the two decades of existence of the franchise, offering such a complete experience that you can get tired of playing its levels and not finish it. This is perhaps its main flaw, that it's not a game that renews itself or changes its mechanics. If you are definitely not attracted to its premise from the start, this may not be the game for you. Its mini-games are great fun to play in meetings with friends.                             
80	                                It's hard to call this an absolutely definitive collection of these classic gaming curios when aspects aren't perhaps quite as authentic as they could be, but when there's so little in it for the most part (and when the aspects that have changed more notably are still great despite feeling different), Banana Mania stands as a feature-packed reminder that 'simple' and 'easy' are not nearly as interchangeable as a lot of people might think.                            
80	                                This is a fantastic collection that not only fans of the franchise will enjoy, as it feels perfect for newcomers to find what the Banana Mania is all about.                            
80	                                Expertly aping past glories, Super Monkey Ball: Banana Mania is a definitive compendium of remastered classics, stuffed to the gills with bonus modes, extra characters, and party games. It is, without question, the most fun you can have rolling a monkey in a ball around a maze - that is an empirical fact. You’d be bananas not to buy it.                            
80	                                Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania is a fantastic puzzle game. It's endlessly replayable with plenty of levels and minigames. The multiplayer options are perfect party games, and the unlockable characters and cosmetics add depth to an already engrossing experience. While there are some frustrating moments and a lack of accessibility, I can safely say Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania is one you won't want to miss.                            
80	                                A fabulous collection of one of gaming’s most deceptively difficult games, Super Monkey Ball: Banana Mania is pure, unadulterated fun.                            
70	                                The themed levels are fine, but leaning into more SEGA history would have definitely added to the celebratory feel of Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania. A fine return to monkey-in-ball form, by the way of past glory and frustration.                            
70	                                Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania is weird, expansive and tricky. I just know die-hard fans are going to love that combination, but I’m not sure about anyone else. While its party games are pretty good, there are other compilations out there with a better assortment… and online play, and the capacity more than 4 players. Countering all my complaints, Banana Mania is competitively priced, so might warrant a look if you’re familiar with how the franchise plays. How’s that for a backhanded endorsement?                            
70	                                Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania isn't going to win any game of the year awards, but it's undeniably fun. While it's perhaps not the entry that will put the series back into the mainstream, fans of the original will likely have a good time and newcomers will see what the fuss is all about. While there are some questionable design choices, such as a finicky camera and microtransactions that feel out of place, this is an enjoyable adventure with AiAi and his friends.                            
60	                                Super Monkey Ball: Banana Mania is full of content and a joyful multiplayer to compete with your friends, but its beauty seems to be matched only by its insane difficulty.                            
60	                                After Banana Blitz HD deemed too simple by the majority of players, the Super Monkey Ball saga decides to go back to its beginnings to offer early fans what they expect: a level of difficulty. Unfortunately, even if the challenge is indeed present, Super Monkey Ball: Banana Mania disappoints. The 4K / 60fps combo available on next-gen is not enough to hide the many flaws of this remaster, starting with the camera which lacks flexibility and the general level-design which plays too much with chance. However, if you hang on to the formula, note that you get what you pay for. The content is more than generous, the replayability is strong and the store is a pleasant surprise that adds extra interest.                             
60	                                Nostalgia might have some fans of Super Monkey Ball trapped in the little ball with them, running their little feet, futile against the inevitability of gravity. But for those not already on the inside, Super Monkey Ball: Banana Mania is skippable.                            
90	                                Phoenix Point: Behemoth Edition is a fantastic turn-based strategy game. Its unrivaled world-building and innovative combat make this a must-play for fans of the genre. If you can overcome the lack of variety in the early game, then be prepared to lose hours upon hours as you race to save humanity from complete obliteration.                            
82	                                It definitely has its issues but I thoroughly enjoyed my time with Phoenix Point: Behemoth Edition. From its clever battle mechanics to its depiction of a world at the brink of utter annihilation; it's one immersive and exceptionally rewarding SRPG.                            
80	                                An SRPG big hitter just got bigger, but did it get better? If you are up to the challenge, this is the best the genre has to offer on PS4.                            
75	                                Phoenix Point manages to blend the very numbers-based approach of classic X-Com with some of modern XCOM’s streamlining. The result is a colossal, cavernous tactical strategy game that struggles to hold its shape at times. Its wealth of information and systems requires patience, but if you can persevere, it’s very much worth the time.                            
70	                                Phoenix Point: Behemoth Edition is a solid turn-based strategy game, which in this version can count on the addition of four DLCs that further increase the contents and therefore the duration of the experience. However, controls can be very tricky and cumbersome on console, while loading times are pretty long.                            
70	                                Phoenix Point: Behemoth Edition is a strategic RPG with uninspired artificial intelligence, technical problems and with some drops in framerate on PlayStation 4. Despite an engaging story, it is a porting that doesn't bring big news.                            
70	                                Phoenix Point is a game I desperately wanted to love. It has exceptionally complex and deep mechanics, solid turn-based combat systems and fun global strategy gameplay, coupled with a decent story and some decent new additions to provide it its own identity. It is also, however, riddled with technical problems, inconsistent mechanics and frustrating difficulty spikes. Like a true phoenix, it can rise with glory when it wants to, I only wish it didn’t thud back down to ashes so frequently.                            
70	                                On paper it does everything XCOM does and more, but poor balancing and overcomplicated rules means it’s just not as much fun.                            
70	                                Two years later, the same assessment can be made for Phoenix Point, even if it is an interesting tactical game with potential, it is still not finished. Some of the bugs have been fixed, and the content has been greatly enriched by the DLC included in this edition, but shortcuts have been taken, which spoiled their potential, and no effort has been made to really integrate them into the whole. Balancing is still an issue, and progression can become frustrating if you increase the difficulty. As for the console port, it's satisfactory in terms of controller controls, but you'll need to have a lot of patience to tolerate the excessively long load times.                            
60	                                Phoenix Point: Behemoth Edition offers the same wealth of content available on the PC, and the controller support is good enough for those willing to overlook some fiddly inventory and menu management. However, the technical performance is far beneath what it should be, so your best bet is to wait for the promised patches to arrive, or simply enjoy a smoother ride on PC if you can.                            
60	                                Between combat with free-aim and comprehensive exploration through the Geoscape, Phoenix Point: Behemoth Edition has a lot of content to offer. Like other strategy games, such as Empire of Sin, players can win multiple ways, and there are plenty of chances to lose. Unfortunately, the console edition has a lot of issues with loading and crashing, but as long as players have the patience, the game is still enjoyable. Phoenix Point: Behemoth Edition comes with the base game and four DLC expansions for players to tactfully explore.                            
80	                                This “renaissance” brings back a classic with new content but keeping its still interesting core very much alive.                            
70	                                Actraiser Renaissance is a very worthy remake, but one that is far from perfect. It starts slow and it's very tutorial heavy. You expect more speed in a title from the 16-bit era, but this is not the case. If you can handle the beginning, you are going to find a very entertaining game with platforming and tower defense strategy elements.                            
70	                                There's a generous amount of content, which at 20 hours is four times the completion size of the original. Since this retro remake is a game of three thirds, it'd be a disservice if followers of the original lost faith from initial impressions of the unsightly side-scrolling action, and an overly gabby god game. Yet, fans won't be on cloud nine if a lack of support towards Actraiser Renaissance discourages Square Enix from being devoted to ActRaiser as a promising series.                            
70	                                A strangle little blend of god sim and hack and slash genres, Actraiser Renaissance is extremely uneven to say the least in almost all facets of its design and yet despite that, it's also oddly compelling and enjoyable. A proper little curio indeed.                            
70	                                This is a game that brushes up against a lot of different genres without diving too deeply into any of them, and some players are going to either clock out from that or find that they like one or two parts but not all three. It is kind of a weird game and it is not going to be everyone’s cup of tea. But if the idea of the game sounds interesting to you? Hey, this is a classic remastered and improved, and it’s well worth the asking price.                            
70	                                In a nutshell, it does a great job of improving and respecting many elements of the source material, but adds too much filler content. Actraiser Renaissance is far from perfect, but it’s a must play for fans of the SNES original.                            
70	                                There’s one thing for certain: Actraiser Renaissance is much better than SolSeraph, the spiritual sequel to the ActRaiser series released in 2019. It has its flaws in both the action and settlement-building stages, but they’re quite easily overlooked in the grand scheme of things thanks to the fact that it’s still such a unique blend. Add in a fantastic soundtrack reworked by Yuzo Koshiro as well as additional content and multiple difficulty levels, and you have a game that should please the majority of series fans while also possibly bringing some new ones into the fold.                            
65	                                This is a good remake, adding some good things to the formula established by the original SNES game. But there too many moments of tutorials and boring dialogue that bog down the pace of the game.                            
60	                                Actraiser Renaissance is a surprise return of a long-lost classic, but one which falls flat in execution in more ways than one. It has moments of brilliance, and there is undoubtedly substance and depth in its many systems. Still, all the moving parts don’t come together cohesively or logically, and it ultimately feels like two completely unrelated games taped together as one, with neither fully complementing the other. Old school fans will no doubt find the experience worth investing in after the tedious start, but for most other players, there are just plenty of far better alternatives.                            
94	                                If you enjoy Metroidvania games even a little bit then picking up Castlevania Advance Collection should be a no-brainer. The included titles have held up beautifully and they're each jam-packed with monster-slaying good times. Here's hoping for Castlevania DS Collection.                            
90	                                Castlevania Advance Collection is one of the best game collections available today with three quality Castlevania releases and a bonus extra game complemented by a wealth of additional features and content.                            
90	                                Castlevania Advance Collection really showcases a side of Konami we don't see very often anymore.                            
85	                                Castlevania Advance Collection is legitimately one of the best gaming experiences I’ve ever had. The collection of this trilogy is magnificent, boasting satisfying, methodical progression, great soundtracks, and addictive RPG systems. Even Dracula X, which caters to a different crowd, doesn’t take away from these classic GBA titles. The package provides some standout gaming action and you owe it to yourself to pick it up.                            
85	                                A Collection that includes some of the most representative and entertaining 2D episodes of the entire saga. Let's hope that Konami will soon put in the hands of M2 the chapters for Nintendo DS.                            
85	                                The Castlevania Advance Collection is a fine piece of game preservation, collecting three good games and a half-assed dud thrown in for good measure. Joking aside, the games haven't aged as well as the NDS trilogy, but put together they make a must-have package for fans of the Belmont family.                            
80	                                Castlevania Advance Collection is a great nostalgic experience, a pure 2D action adventure compilation.                            
80	                                As for collection bonuses, there’s an encyclopaedia for each that gives you important details about the enemies,items, and powers in each of the three good games. There’s also a rewind function. Basically, you can go back a bit if you’ve messed something up, or if you took a wrong turn and can’t be bothered to backtrack. The Castlevania Advance Collection is 75% absolutely excellent, and that’s more than enough for us. Now, can we get the DS collection too? [Issue#7, p.90]                            
80	                                Four slices of Castlevania with slightly different toppings. Aria of Sorrow is the jewel of a crown enriched by several extras and options. Simply irresistible.                            
80	                                In short, it remains a recommended purchase for the nostalgic of the Konami series and for those who love the Metroidvania genre.                             
80	                                Out of all the games Aria of Sorrow has aged the best and is the star of this collection. Circle of the Moon and Harmony of Dissonance don’t shine as bright, but are still great titles. Dracula X is worth playing, but it can be described as good but not great and seems like it would be more at home in the Anniversary Collection. Overall, Castlevania Advance Collection is a dream collection for Castlevania fans.                            
80	                                It's hard to sulk your pleasure in front of this Castlevania Advance Collection. For twenty euros, players can discover and rediscover three essentials of the Game Boy Advance. If the weather hasn't been so good with the SNES opus, Harmony of Dissonance, Aria of Sorrow and Circle of the Moon haven't aged a bit. So now is the perfect opportunity to add 3 great metroidvania to your collection. Too bad only one of them benefits from a French translation.                             
85	                                Out of its comfort zone, Runeterra's world shines in this well-crafted and smart RPG, that feels just like a first step in a journey that is going to bring League of Legends up to new shores.                            
80	                                Ruined King: A League of Legends Story isn't reinventing the wheel, that's for sure. However, its solid game systems make it quite a recommendable RPG, especially for LoL fans. They will be able to appreciate the reinterpretation of their favorite universe by Airship Syndicate and Joe Madureira. And while we regret a somewhat conventional writing that sometimes lacks subtlety, we appreciate being able to immerse ourselves in the alleys of Bilgewater and the Dark Isles in the company of charismatic champions.                             
80	                                Ruined King: A League of Legends Story is a story-driven, turn based role-playing game (RPG). It features fan favorite champions, innovative turn-based combat and beautiful art direction.                            
80	                                Another captivating RPG by Joe Madureira and friends, this time in the League of Legends realm. Gorgeous and demanding, Ruined King needs just a little bit of tuning to become an unmissable one.                            
80	                                It is clear that Ruined King: A League of Legends Story is a work of love, combining a well-written narrative, engaging characters, and a world worth exploring and experiencing. The combat elements add to a familiar formula, and the turn-based elements are not that hard for anyone to wrap their heads around. Save for a few yet annoying bugs and glitches, it is hard not to see Ruined King: A League of Legends Story as a bonafide breakout hit for Riot Forge and Airship Syndicate.                             
70	                                Ruined King: A League of Legends Story is not one to miss. This game will surprise you with its exciting dungeons, dynamic boss battles, one-of-a-kind combat mechanics, and charming characters.                            
70	                                Without revolutionizing the genre, Ruined King: A League of Legends Story does everything it sets out to do very well. In this way, it will satisfy both MOBA fans and those looking for a complete and content-laden turn-based RPG.                             
55	                                Ruined King: A League of Legends Story is a competent narrative adventure for fans of the base game, but it barely scrapes by as a standalone game for newcomers to the series. The turn-based combat mechanics are refreshing, and the story elements are there. Still, the number of outdated gameplay components and flagrant unpolish that make progression borderline impossible ultimately makes this an engaging spectacle than an enjoyable playable experience.                            
100	                                I often say that the original Blue Reflection is the most beautiful game. I say that because while it obviously didn’t compare to the AAA-blockbusters in terms of the money that has been thrown at it, the art direction was so pitch-perfect and downright beautiful that the technical limitations were irrelevant. Second Light clearly had a bigger budget and made the most of that to present a more refined and confident take on the Blue Reflection vision. The story is a vibrant, the JRPG action is classical and engaging, and the aesthetics are pristine. Getting something this wholesome and pure is a rare treat in an industry obsessed with hard and serious storytelling and adult themes, and I strongly suspect that, just like the original Blue Reflection, I’m not going to be able to get Second Light out of my mind for years to come.                             
90	                                Blue Reflection: Second Light is a beautiful game in every way. It looks fantastic, plays great, and sounds incredible. It’s challenging, rewarding, and a unique experience through and through. It has a hopeful, positive message and the story is a fun and winding ride. The presentation is top-notch, and the game itself demonstrates what Gust has learned in the past four years from their Atelier games. For those looking for a magical girl JRPG to play, consider checking out the entire series. For fans of the original game and anime, I highly recommend Blue Reflection: Second Light. It is one of Gust’s best games to date and easily the best game in the magical girl media subgenre.                            
84	                                Blue Reflection Second Light is a powerful story of a group of magical girls stuck in a world where males just don’t exist. While they explore their past, bonds are created to deliver fun and energic moments of storytelling made grander by emotional story beats. The action-focused battle system is fast and addictive, and exploration is straightforward without weighing the experience. It’s a low barrier of entry JRPG with plenty of charm to warrant a playthrough.                            
80	                                Blue Reflection: Second Light is a perfect example of judging a game on what it tried to be, and not what it isn’t. While it pales in comparison to other blockbuster Japanese role-playing games, and remains constrained by the long-standing limitations of its developer, it is an enjoyable and engrossing adventure when taken for what it is: a mid-tier RPG that brings together a group of fleshed-out characters who are trying to improve both their lives and their world. Coming off the original Blue Reflection, Second Light genuinely advances the franchise both in terms of storytelling and gameplay, offering an even better experience to those looking for this sort of game.                            
80	                                For fans of the original game, Blue Reflection: Second Light is a must-play, with yet another engrossing story and some meaningful gameplay enhancements. But even those who haven’t played the original may want to delve into this sequel if they’re into emotionally-charged JRPGs that dare to experiment a little. This is a more serious affair from Gust, with some touching moments as pasts are revealed and new relationships are formed. And with its energetic battle system that keeps you on your toes, it’s captivating from beginning to end.                            
80	                                Blue Reflection: Second Light is an improvement upon the first game, following a group of schoolgirls looking for a way back home while fighting evil monsters.                            
80	                                I can’t remember the last time I’ve seen a franchise take such a massive positive 180 as I’ve seen here in Second Light. What was easily one of the worst games I played in 2017 has received a follow-up that kept me coming back for more. It really feels like Gust took the criticism of the original to heart here. We’ve gone from a massive stumble of a game with some good ideas to an incredibly solid JRPG that does just about everything it sets out to do correctly. From the character writing to the speedy gameplay, the world design to the excellent soundtrack, this is a game worth taking a look at. If you are interested in jumping into this franchise, take my advise: just skip the first game completely. Start here with Second Light, it’s worth your time.                            
80	                                Blue Reflection: Second Light is a fine role-playing game, with a pleasing art direction that makes up for its cross-gen nature and modest budget. The storyline takes a while to get going and the multi-faceted combat system tends to drag common encounters for too long, but overall the game will surely appeal to those who don't mind the unusual setting.                            
80	                                Blue Reflection: Second Light is an improvement over the original in every way. It's a brilliant blend of action and storytelling, where both side complement each other perfectly. Some of the side systems like stealth and facility building are a bit flawed, but the meat of the game is divine – incredible combat, memorable characters, and a stunning soundtrack make this a must-play for any JRPG enthusiast.                            
79	                                I'm thoroughly impressed at how much better of a game Blue Reflection: Second Light is when you compare it to the first game. In fact, it's so good that I kind of feel mean for disliking the original as much as I did. Here's hoping for a Third Light!                            
75	                                Blue Reflection: Second Light takes the basis of the first game and creates a JRPG with a more interesting and tactically varied combat system and team management. Unfortunately, the low difficulty level limits the game's potential.                            
70	                                A slower-paced J-RPG but which offers a calm and soothing experience that will especially appeal to fans of Japanese productions.                             
70	                                Blue Reflection: Second Light is an RPG in which a group of girls with lost memories find themselves in a different dimension in which they have to work together to solve a mystery. The main scenario – in which you will learn about the girls’ difficult pasts while seeing them grow as characters – feels satisfactory due to plenty of events throughout the game. While the battle system feels good enough to do the job, it comes with too many rough edges.                            
70	                                Blue Reflection: Second Light is a solid second step for a new series. It is visually charming throughout and turns out to have an intriguing story with engaging exploration and a simple yet fun battle system. Aside from the fact that the girls are over-sexualized, with odd interactions and some improper looks for their age, the game is surely recommendable. The series looks promising, and surely many players will be looking forward to a third entry.                            
70	                                With Blue Reflection: Second Light, Gust has chosen to expand and to revolutionize the good features of the first chapter, showing to strongly believe in this franchise.                            
70	                                Blue Reflection: Second Light might not break any molds when it comes to JRPGs, but it does a solid job blending different gameplay mechanics with an emotional tale of reconnecting to old friends and making peace with the past. Players who enjoyed the social interactions and teen drama of modern Persona games should feel right at home here, as Blue Reflection: Second Light has all the ingredients of a decent anime-style high school adventure.                                      
67	                                Compared to the original, Blue Reflection: Second Light undoubtedly represents a big step forward for the boys of Gust, who have once again synthesized an exciting and frenetic playful formula. However, the progress made on the gameplay front and the unexpected introduction of a more traditional growth system are again offset by an uninspiring tale, sleepy and repetitive side activities, and a technical system that is dated even by last year's standards. console generation. The road to obtain redemption is therefore still long, but it would seem that the majokko of the house Gust and Koei Tecmo have at least taken the right path.                             
60	                                It's a shame that Blue Reflection: Second Light couldn't live up to the expectations it set for itself. Though the story and characters development is good, the game is held back by overly complicated combat mechanics that seem to make encounters harder and longer when they didn't need to be. With the franchise now two games deep, I have to wonder if a third entry will ever get the light of day and if so, will GUST Studios finally be able to get the formula right.                            
100	                                Back 4 Blood definitely builds on Left 4 Dead, and it doesn’t drive too far from that steady formula. But the Left 4 Dead formula still works, and it’s a recipe for quick cooperative gaming fun whenever you take it on. Yes, there are other cooperative games out there, titles with deeper story and more lore or more involved progression. There may not be a cooperative game that’s easier to instantly jump into, though, than Back 4 Blood.                            
90	                                Back 4 Blood has the best water-cooler moments of any game released in 2021.                            
90	                                If you played Left 4 Dead, you’ll feel right at home. Back 4 Blood is a more mature and more bad-ass version of L4D, elevating every mechanic from the former series and making it better while adding in new features that makes playing far more rewarding.                             
85	                                Back 4 Blood is loads of fun no matter which mode you play. The game supports cross platform (and cross gen) play for both multiplayer and co-op modes. The campaign is easily the best part of the game, but the multiplayer mode is a good companion mode. So long as you don’t mind that the game is always online and that there isn’t much of a single player mode at the moment, the game is quite good. I’m not much of a fan of online multiplayer shooters, but this type of game with loads of replay value is what I look for whenever I do play one. Like I said at the start, I don’t know how the game compares to Left 4 Dead, but that really shouldn’t matter much since Back 4 Blood is its own game, and it’s a lot of fun.                            
85	                                Back 4 Blood is a gory party that begins as soon as you start the first level and never decreases in intensity. It still has some of the Left 4 Dead's essence, but it's a completely different game and the changes suit it wonderfully.                            
82	                                Turtle Rock Studios managed to successfully resurrect the original Left 4 Dead games formula, improving it with modern shooter mechanics, very fun gunplay and a lot of variety thanks to the new card system. It's not a very innovative game and it's got some technical and balancing issues, but it can be damn fun and addictive.                            
82	                                Back 4 Blood is the successor to Left 4 Dead, adding new enemies and an excellent card system with power-ups and new challenges.                            
80	                                Back 4 Blood is a fun co-op shooter and the perfect answer to a boring afternoon especially, if you have a friend to back you up. If you want to play solo, you're gonna have to look somewhere else.                            
80	                                At the time of this writing a few patches have gone out that have corrected most of the larger bugs, but there are still issues with spawning too many special infected at a time and other little issues. While these things can be frustrating, they don’t destroy the fun of Back 4 Blood when playing the game as it’s meant to be. That is playing multiplayer with a group of friends smartly navigating a nightmare filled world. Those looking to have a single player experience on the other hand may not find as much here to love, while Turtle Rock is working to fix the progression and reward issue for single players at the time of this writing there isn’t an ETA for those fixes. So, for that reason I wouldn’t recommend this for solo’s just yet, however for those folks who have been waiting for Left 4 Dead 3, or heard about how fun the original ones were and never tried them and have a team ready to face the undead… then what are you waiting for cleaner? Get out there and kill some ridden!                            
80	                                Back 4 Blood is a great successor to Left 4 Dead. Although it has some flaws, the title offers a fantastic experience when playing it with friends, which added to the mastery with which the progression system has been set up, make the title an absolute must for those who like the genre.                             
80	                                It is fast, brutal, punishing and can bring complete strangers together into a zombie mincing machine. Swarm is there if you have the PvP itch, and if you can play with others, this is an easy sell. If you play alone, things are more problematic, as a lot of the game seems to be locked away from you, but co-op up and you’ll be sorted with the zombie killing sprees of Back 4 Blood.                            
80	                                Despite a messy start, this spiritual successor to Left 4 Dead becomes more challenging and characterful the longer you spend with it.                            
80	                                Back 4 Blood certainly improves upon the gameplay formula of Turtle Rock’s earlier Left 4 Dead, with a deeper feature set that allows for greater strategy and customization while fending off Hordes of the undead. But the world of the game and its characters lack the charm of its spiritual forebear, and a few curious design choices keep it just shy of greatness.                            
80	                                Playing cards offer great build options and enough variety, the flow in the surprisingly long levels is fun and the zombie shooting feels good old-fashioned. Back 4 Blood is a challenging, almost sadistic evolution of the Left 4 Dead formula that will appeal only to hardcore fans of the genre. But that's why the lack of a PvP campaign is incomprehensible.                             
80	                                Back 4 Blood is the perfect way to end a long day doing something that almost anyone can enjoy: absent-mindlessly destroying zombies. The 'fathers' of Left 4 Dead are back with a full display of adrenaline, but also including strategic components that notably enhance the overall experience. If only the single player component weren't so poor.                            
80	                                A blistering return to zombie-slaying nirvana, Back 4 Blood is an excellent spiritual follow-up to Left 4 Dead that ticks almost all of the right boxes, except for the one labelled 'solo progression' – if you're planning on playing offline on your own, you might want to steer clear for now. Otherwise, jump right in.                            
80	                                Back 4 Blood is one of my comfort food games of 2021. It is an excellent time with friends that scratches an itch I’ve had since the glory days of Left 4 Dead. While it never reaches the heights of its inspiration, the addition of cards makes me hungry to play more, even when the game isn’t at its strongest.                            
80	                                Back 4 Blood wastes no time trying to divert your attention from its obvious influences, but it doesn’t need to when it nearly lives up to the expectations its spiritual predecessors set so high.                            
80	                                Back 4 Blood is the co-op survival shooter that we’ve been waiting for since Left 4 Dead took the world by storm. The introduction of Corruption Cards really helps the game stand out, while offering players varied gameplay that doesn’t feel stale at any point. The current issues surrounding solo play are certainly a turn-off, but not enough for me to not recommend playing it, especially if you have a group of friends ready to go. With a little TLC, Back 4 Blood has every ingredient necessary to flourish, and perhaps even dethrone its predecessors… maybe.                            
80	                                Is Back 4 Blood the Left 4 Dead 3 we've been waiting for? Yes! It's a worthy spiritual successor to Valve's classic zombie-slaying series of multiplayer games, and offers a well-designed Campaign mode with some impressive new features such as its strategic Card system. The difficulty perhaps needs balancing a little more, and the lack of meaningful progression when playing Solo Campaign needs addressing sharpish, but otherwise we've had a blast with Back 4 Blood so far, and we look forward to many more Campaign runs in the weeks, months and years to come.                            
80	                                Back 4 Blood is more than Left 4 Dead 3 with another name. It presents a strategic use of cards and a well developed progression system that guarantees a lot of fun and replayability.                            
75	                                So while Back 4 Blood isn’t quite a slam dunk when it comes to other co-op shooters on the market, it’s still a pretty fun zombie killing time that will be easy for people to pick up and play but may take some time to get acquainted with maps, objectives, and what can often feel like a steep difficulty curve. I’m sure there are multiple things that can be ironed out as the development team focuses on bugs, servers, and difficulty balancing, but out of the gate it’s a fun enough experience for sure, and worth checking out. Also worth noting that this is a Game Pass title, making it sort of a no-brainer if you’re on an Xbox platform.                             
75	                                Back 4 Blood is indeed the worthy heir of the first two Left 4 Dead games. There is no doubt about that. The title from Turtle Rock Studios offers nervous and impacting gameplay that knows how to reinvent itself as the players progress thanks to this successful deck system and these varied objectives that take place in many different places. Unfortunately, the production still lacks balancing. The game is either too simple or too punitive. We hope that a future update will correct all this.                             
75	                                You'll find a lot of fun in Back 4 Blood. Turtle Rock Studios managed to take something that was old and give it enough of a touch-up to make sure we recognized it but played with it differently. It's fun to hop on with your friends and blast away the zombies and compete to potentially take out the Cleaners, but you have to get past the first half of the game to get to the best parts. It doesn't help that the story gives you nothing to cling to, but once you get past those parts, the tension and excitement kick in. But sadly, playing solo hardly gives you anything like what you get playing online and with friends.                            
75	                                In the end, Back 4 Blood is indeed Left 4 Dead 3 under a different name, trying to recover the magic recipe that made the success of the two previous installments, without ever managing to surpass them. Indeed, the absence of a real versus mode on the campaign coupled with the fact that its scenario is less engaging make it a good game, but not a very good one. We won't neglect its hyper fun and bloody side which will delight a good number of players who will play it in co-op and especially with friends. As for the players who want to try it alone, we advise them to pass their way because of the lack of fun linked to the catastrophic AI of the bots.                            
70	                                Back 4 Blood isn't perfect by any means, but it's absolutely the closest we've gotten to a new Left 4 Dead game in the years since Left 4 Dead 2. Because of this, it's hard not to have fun with B4B, even if it doesn't always feel inventive and has some notable drawbacks. Despite some qualms, if you're hungry for a new co-op shooter to jump into with some friends, Back 4 Blood has more than enough meat on the bone to keep you entertained for quite some time.                             
70	                                If you can give Back 4 Blood a chance, then eventually the game will open up as a fun and original 4-player co-op based shooter.                            
70	                                At its best, Back 4 Blood offers a ton of variety to keep you and your friends interested for a long time. Even returning to levels you’ve already played gets interesting thanks to different cards, which can make major differences in how things play out. If you have three friends to play the whole game with, I highly recommend it. That its available as a Game Pass title is awesome because you can get a group of friends together without them all having to buy the game. If you don’t have that group though, a poorly balanced solo mode and issues with matchmaking will sink this one for most.                            
70	                                We have been given a finely tooled zombie shooter, but it lacks the power of the original. This has less to do with its diminished darkness—Left 4 Dead was a far gloomier ride, lit by the panicked sway of torches—and more to do with us. And with the years. There is plenty to enjoy here, and I heartily recommend it to any who relish killing the dead. But Turtle Rock Studios wants to take us back to another time, and it’s 2 Late 4 That.                            
70	                                Back 4 Blood still comes out as the best Left 4 Dead-inspired game in recent memory, taking the core design and innovating on it just enough to keep everything fresh and fun. Where Back 4 Blood gets things right, it does them really well, but where it doesn’t is often quite obvious.                            
70	                                Back 4 Blood is the spiritual successor of Left 4 Dead but it's also more than this. Its sub-roguelike card system refresh the zombie-coop-FPS formula but the game needs some polish and a solid post-launch support.                            
65	                                It’s hard to fault the moment-to-moment gameplay of Back 4 Blood when all of its pistons are working in tandem and you’re running with a good crew. Though the effort to contemporise and grow beyond its roots is commendable, just about every other aspect of the game feels like a misfire. The campaign isn’t fun and, more offensively, it pays no regard to solo players.                            
65	                                A tedious, time-consuming playing card mechanic, frustrating bug crashes and a repetitive, near-endless onslaught of Ridden enemies led by an uninspired AI Director, collectively drags this spiritual sequel to Left 4 Dead down from the heights it could have reached.                            
60	                                As homages go, it's reverential yet poisoned by doubt. It doesn't trust Left 4 Dead's genius enough to let it stand alone. [Issue#365, p.106]                            
60	                                I so badly want to love Back 4 Blood, but its grindy nature and difficulty spikes out of nothing let it down, leaving you with a bad taste in your mouth. It has potential for those in it for the long haul, accumulating cards and building specialised decks to match the challenge, but right now I just have no desire to go back 4 more.                             
60	                                It's been more than a decade since Left 4 Dead 2 and Turtle Rock is now back to reclaim the throne. Back 4 Blood is not a revolution, though. Instead, it's an evolution of the developer's already excellent gameplay from before. Although we would have liked less of the small flaws we find, it does not stop the game from being a really entertaining and addictive shooter. With human teammates, that is.                             
60	                                Back 4 Blood isn’t a bad game. But it could have been so much better. Its difficulty needs balancing, as does the amount of enemies thrown at you at any one time. Ultimately, most levels simply have too much going on to be enjoyable – and each Act would have benefitted from being substantially shorter. Get a competent group of friends together and you might have some fun, but chances are zombie fatigue is going to set in long before you reach the end of the campaign.                            
60	                                It seems backhanded to say that a game is only worth playing if you can find people to distract you from the actual game, but if your group wants something mindless to wind down after an intense night on Warzone or Rainbow Six: Siege, Back 4 Blood is ideal.                            
50	                                With Back 4 Blood available on Xbox Game Pass on PC and Console there’s reason to jump in if you’re looking for something new to play with friends. The look and feel is familiar and the action is engaging and chaotic when played with a group. For a while that is. Thanks to the sameness that permeates across most levels and backdrops and the predictability of the pace, it doesn’t take long for this Left 4 Dead spiritual successor to wear a little thin.                            
50	                                Back 4 Blood comes after a decade of L4D-likes and from the studio that made the timeless original, but it fails to capture the same magic even as well as some prior imitators.                            
100	                                If you have never played Death Stranding and are on the fence about picking it up, this is the version to go for. Everything about it has been improved upon, and navigation has been perfected, so if you don’t want to walk 20 minutes to every destination, the Director’s Cut has supplied you with all the right tools to make it faster and more efficient.                            
100	                                I don't have much to say about Death Stranding that I didn't already say back in 2019. The game remains the excellent and unique piece of art that it is. The "Director's Cut" stuff is an absolute bust and I'm disappointed that such cynical "blockbusterisms" have been applied to Kojima's work in particular. However, this is more than outweighed by the utterly different tone that eminates from the game, now that it comes across as reflective rather than prophetic. It might be sobering, but it's worth musing over.                            
100	                                If you’re a newcomer to Death Stranding, the Directors Cut is the best way to play an absolute masterpiece, and I’m very jealous that you’ll be able to engage with it in all its glory. Some of the systemic chaff has been cut out to maintain the atmosphere while making your adventure a little less punishing, and, as a result, it feels far more accessible than it was at launch. Death Stranding feels at home on the PS5 with its enhanced immersion, loading times, framerate bump and graphical fidelity, elevating an already great game into something extraordinary. Returning players are also getting a lot of bang for their buck if they upgrade thanks to a job lot of new content and lore, providing a great excuse to transfer your data, slip on your Bridges Boots and dive back in.                            
100	                                Death Stranding Director’s Cut is a game with a ton going on. It’s an easy recommendation for anyone looking for a creative and enjoyable experience. The only question for those who played the original version is whether or not they enjoyed their first trip through Kojima’s brilliant creation. If you did, or if this is your first time playing Death Stranding, you are absolutely going to love every second of the Death Stranding Director’s Cut.                            
100	                                Death Stranding remains a bizarre masterpiece on PS5, and the director’s cut only further cements that reputation with a number of worthwhile new ideas that enhance the act of delivering packages across a picturesque landscape of nothingness. The story of Sam Porter Bridges is overblown and wondrous, taking hold of you and refusing to let go as you’re dragged into an adventure that takes the medium to places it has never been before. It’s mindless self-indulgence of the highest order, and it’s rare to see a game deliver upon its overarching ambition in such a bold, uncompromising way in the modern era. For that very reason, it deserves to be celebrated.                            
100	                                Every new line of code written enhances the original experience, bringing new ways for existing players to enjoy Death Stranding again. Whether you're here for exploring the factory and playing with the new toys like I am or want to challenge friends for top spot on the racing and firing range leaderboards, odds are there is a reason for you to come back. Reworked missions will aid new players into the world more smoothly than the original release, too. I definitely felt as though the difficulty spike wasn't nearly as harsh thanks to this. Keep in mind that while the Director's Cut expands and adds delicate touches here and there, this is still a game that requires patience and time for the best results.                            
100	                                Director's Cut is the definitive version of Kojima Productions' masterpiece. It delivers an incredibly pertinent story, with more content than ever before, to be experienced through ingenious integration of the PlayStation 5's DualSense.                            
100	                                The 'Director's Cut' of Death Stranding is basically the same game we once enjoyed on PS4 but taking advantage of all of the technical prowess of the PS5, plus there are some interesting additions to top it off.                            
98	                                Two years later, Death Stranding is still an atypical and compelling adventure that managed to transport us for more than fifty hours. No matter how much we might grumble about the weaknesses of its creator's writing, the fact remains that its unique concept still holds up well, while its panoramas are sublimated by the PS5's optimizations. So the verdict is pretty much the same as for other editions of this kind on Sony's machine: if you've never played the original game, go for it, but if you've already played it, the new content doesn't necessarily justify paying for it again.                            
95	                                Death Stranding Director's Cut is full of big and small adjustments. Some changes make the game a little more accessible, while others, such as the racetrack, increase the already stark contrast between the more playful and more serious side of the game.                            
95	                                Two years later, Death Stranding remains a masterpiece. Undoubtedly always so divisive, the last born of Kojima Productions offers a unique gaming experience, transfigured by the capacities of a PlayStation 5 allowing him to give everything he has in the belly, to the point of pouring into bulimia new unpublished content. Admittedly, not all are equal, but the experience offered by this Director's Cut is complete, can potentially suit more player profiles, can potentially appeal to those who had succumbed to this fantastic and exotic journey on PS4 and who will appreciate to (re) live new adventures with a Norman Reedus larger than life. Certainly a must have for anyone who owns a PS5 and wants to embark on a unique game that is landmark and still upsets us today.                             
95	                                Death Stranding Director's Cut is a magnificent game, bringing in plenty of new stuff that genuinely improves the overall experience.                            
93	                                Two years after its original release, Death Stranding is still a masterpiece, with a moving story, unforgettable characters and impressive visuals. New gameplay mechanics, missions and minigames don't add much to a game that already felt like a director´s cut.                             
92	                                It’s easy to declare Director’s Cut the best way to play Death Stranding, period. It looks and executes like a dream, and crosses over PS4 saves seamlessly (to include perfect transfer of trophies). Its improved presentation and gameplay additions (notably DualSense integration) are stellar, and make a great game…even greater. Also, the new modes, items and options are icing on an already delicious cake. Death Stranding Director’s Cut is therefore an arguably must buy for PS5 owners new to the game, a solid upgrade previous players will definitely appreciate.                            
92	                                A great game now a little bigger. The new features do not break the gameplay, but give additional variety to the action. The best Death Stranding is here.                            
90	                                If you loved the original, Director's Cut won't really offer anything mindblowing when it comes to the gameplay. A couple of innovations might please those that found the original too sluggish or repetitive, but what really makes the game shine this time around, is a flawless presentation. Graphics, audio and controls, make this as immersive and memorable experience as possible. Still not a title anyone could enjoy, but those who will - won't ever forget it.                            
90	                                Death Stranding Director's Cut is more than extra content, it's a new chance to experience a title that many see wrongly and that deserves to be experienced by all those who love this industry. Kojima's work, misunderstood by so many, reaches its final evolutionary state, with new technological additions that neither compromise the trip nor take away its meaning. A lonely but wonderful journey that deserves a second chance from those who threw the towel in 2019, with visual improvements that elevate the narrative experience, music that enhances a deep soundtrack, and new activities that drown us even more in an hallucinated America. Director’s Cut is the end of a piece of art that has remained closed to so many people, which is now opening doors again, re-presenting one of the most brilliant works of the past generation.                            
90	                                Death Stranding Director's Cut is an artistic vision fully realized. If the original Death Stranding did not entice you, do not expect to be converted. However, if you resonate with the experience being presented, the game is a must-play and the definitive way to enjoy a one-of-a-kind title.                            
90	                                It is undeniable that returning to the world of Death Stranding after the year we've all had was affecting in ways I never anticipated going in. It didn't strike me the first time just how much positive feedback the game gives for every little thing Sam does. It didn't strike me the first time just how accurate the game would be in how isolation makes every interaction with a live human being into an event. The hope, the despair, the determination of it all just plain hits differently now, and in ways that make the game one to experience even if you don't end up liking it enough to stick with it for dozens of hours. The Director's Cut still does an admirable job goosing up that experience for maximum immersion. Even while trying to nudge itself towards something more approachable, there is still nothing quite like this game.                            
90	                                At its core, it's still absolutely amazing, now a bit more beautiful and smoother game.                            
90	                                Death Stranding Director's Cut is for fans of the series who want to replay this title in all its glory on a PS5, but it's mainly for newcomers thanks to tweaks to the early game that make it more accessible.                            
90	                                Death Stranding: Director's Cut is great way to revisit the game, especially if you enjoyed your first playthrough. And now it's time to go back to the roads most taken with your fellow BB in hands. Unity always beats isolation, you only need to make the first step.                            
90	                                Death Stranding makes its debut on PlayStation 5 with a Director's Cut which, while offering players a good dose of unreleased content, does not significantly alter the quality balance of Hideo Kojima's latest work. The playful narrative essence of the production has therefore remained the same as it was two years ago, with all its strengths, its flaws and its overflowing expressive power. With an exceptional technical sector, the monumental epic of Sam Porter Bridges returns to console in its best form, to propose to the public an exceptional science fiction story placed between the meshes of an extraordinarily rich and fascinating imaginary, which frames a poignant story supported by a gameplay as satisfying as it is unique, capable of triggering a pleasant addiction. More than anything else, Death Stranding is the ardent manifestation of the creative flair of an author who is not afraid to challenge the logic and dogmas of the market, with the aim of pushing the medium towards still unexplored territories.                             
90	                                Death Stranding: Director’s Cut must have been the original version of a masterpiece that knew how to never leave anybody unmoved, being unique at the same time. For those who have PS5 and have not played Death Stranding, this Director's Cut is a must for their library. But for those who have already played Sam Porter Bridges's story, the incentives to replay this version are not so juicy.                            
90	                                Death Stranding Director’s Cut brings some additions and gameplay improvements to the original game, thus making it even better. If you still haven’t played Kojima’s masterpiece now is the time.                            
90	                                Death Stranding Director's Cut is a fantastic port of a fascinating game. It introduces lots of new features that enrich the experience, the graphics and performance get a big boost, and PS5's bells and whistles are all put through their paces. It all adds up to make this the best way to play Kojima Productions' insane adventure, whether you're new to the experience or want to pick up where you left off. It's not going to change anyone's mind one way or the other — it's still Death Stranding, like it or not — but Director's Cut certainly presents the game in the best light.                            
90	                                Hideo Kojima is the physical manifestation of the Director’s Cut. Often times his idea of a nice neat package is like having a 6 hour version of 2001: A Space Odyssey, but I’m ever so grateful for his presence in our industry. He’s not scared to take chances and make something people don’t like, and more often than not, he makes things I like or can at least appreciate. Death Stranding is some combination of all those things. I appreciate it, enjoy playing it, and on this third playthrough became more convinced than ever that there’s something really special here for those willing to take the time to stare at their boots.                            
90	                                While I took a lot away from it the first time, Death Stranding Director’s Cut affected me far more and left an even more positive impression. Regardless of whether someone likes it or not, it sticks with you. Even if the story doesn’t click, the underlying concepts stay with you. And at a time when we can’t easily travel or connect, having this game where you can and make a difference in strangers’ lives online is very welcome.                            
90	                                Death Stranding Director's Cut continues to impress with its fearless commitment to fetch quests on top of fetch quests, and again, it's not going to change your mind if you didn't already buy into what it was selling back in 2019. But if you did, the Director's Cut enhances and enriches that original experience, and you'll be happy you jumped back into this one.                            
90	                                Death Stranding Director’s Cut is an oddly named excuse to get addicted to delivering all over again. The visuals are stunning, but the haptics and new gadgets take things to even greater heights. Its themes have never been more relevant, and its gameplay never more fun.                            
90	                                Death Stranding Director’s Cut is a visual and technical marvel that introduces a number of features that, while not essential, absolutely add to the overall experience.                            
90	                                Death Stranding the Director's Cut is the definitive way to experience the game and is worth checking out for those who may have missed it on other platforms.                             
90	                                It is unlikely that those who hated Death Stranding in its standard version will be able to change their judgment about the Director's Cut; all other players, on the other hand, shouldn't miss the opportunity to live and play again the adventure of Sam Porter Bridges.                            
88	                                On the PS5 Death Stranding is as beautiful as ever and this Director's Cut gives players a bunch of new and (quite) interesting content, but not enough to make it feel really new and fresh.                            
87	                                I got to a point where I was not enjoying playing Death Stranding, but I was enjoying watching Death Stranding to see what happened. For me, it would have been better, probably, if the game were much shorter, because I got to where I wanted to experience the story without having to deal with the gameplay. I rarely find myself in that situation! Even still, I recognize the sheer quality and accomplishment Death Stranding is, and the value the Director’s Cut offers, so I find myself still recommending this game. If you are at all curious, you owe it to yourself to try it out, and odds are, you’re going to enjoy it more than not.                            
87	                                I very much enjoyed Death Stranding on the PS4, and that hasn't changed after playing through Death Stranding: Director's Cut on the PS5. It's not perfect in its overall story and gameplay execution, and it isn't a game that everyone will enjoy. If you can get past that, it's still is a uniquely rewarding experience that looks and plays better on a PS5, and it's one of the few PS5 titles that doesn't demand a fortune to upgrade for existent owners. At the same time, the content additions are a bit thin and don't add a lot to the experience, so the upgrades in visuals and performance are likely the main reason to upgrade your version.                            
86	                                Easily the best way to experience building bridges across America, Death Stranding Director's Cut is less of the final cut one might expect from Kojima himself and moreso a collection of novel enhancements to make this the best looking and best feeling way to experience this unique title.                            
85	                                Death Stranding Director's Cut took a good game from Playstation 4 and brought it to the next generation in the best possible way. Every Playstation 5 player should try this game.                             
85	                                This is the best way to play Death Stranding. Some of the additions are great, some seem a bit strange, but that’s exactly what you would expect from Kojima.                            
85	                                Death Stranding: Director's Cut is easily the best way to play the game. The additions are numerous and bound to help players make their journey across America much more palatable. If you’re someone who gave up on Death Stranding because you found it to be too frustrating or long-winded, the Director’s Cut additions could be enough to lure you back. If you’re someone who’s played the game to death already, there’s probably not a whole lot of reason to come back given how little extra content there is.                            
85	                                Though the additions to this newly reinvigorated version of Death Stranding might be considered to be superfluous by die-hard Kojima fans, there's no denying that Death Stranding Director's Cut is the definitive version to play Kojima's most recent opus on console, thanks to an opulent visual makeover and a wealth of quality of life improvements. Though still remaining divisive at its core, Death Stranding Director's Cut is absolutely the best way to see the hype surrounding Kojima's most esoteric work.                             
83	                                When Death Stranding came out in 2019 I was in a bit of a conflict: on the one hand it was a great gameplay experience that presented me with something I hadn't played before, but in terms of story it sometimes completely derailed by tons of dialogue. The Director's Cut gives me the same feeling, but I'm convinced that newcomers will definitely take advantage and enjoy the new quality-of-life additions and the DualSense features. On the other hand, it offers owners of the PlayStation 4 version enough additions and improvements to justify a ten euro upgrade should they want to play this unique game again.                             
82	                                Although the story is interesting, it fails because the missions are designed for infiltration, but the game lacks enough mechanics in that regard. Something similar happens with vehicle racing, that the controls are very simple and were not conceived for a modality of this ready. What is very good is the shooting range, an addition that allows you to test the weapons before using them with the enemy through small missions. In short, with its mistakes, this is the best way to enjoy the experience that Death Stranding proposes.                             
80	                                You’ve also got new tools for making deliveries, such as a cargo cannon, a robot helper, and even an on-foot only, very steep bridge. Nothing here really ousts the base game’s structures, which is for the best as it means the shared network of nearby players continues to stand strong. Some of it may make the game a little easier, but none of it’s really necessary. That holds true for many PS5 upgrades. Death Stranding is better here than it was on the last-gen console, and it might be worth a revisit to see how the land has changed, but it’s not a must-see replay. [Issue#7, p.74]                            
80	                                When playing the original version of Death Stranding, I would have described it as lethargic with some horror elements when dealing the monsters. With Death Stranding Director’s Cut, this opinion was reevaluated. It’s a game about many things. It’s about society and the role each person plays in it. It’s about overcoming depression. It’s about confusing and/or boring friends when they watch me play it. This is a chill game punctuated with tense moments, with a pacing that I didn’t appreciate until this edition. As an unexpectedly-improved release, Death Stranding: Director’s Cut is well worth the time for the curious or the existing fans, proving that Kojima still knows how to surprise.                            
80	                                The original game itself is a triumphant genre experiment, but viewing these new additions in a singular lens begs the question: is it worth upgrading? Simply, yes. Death Stranding Director's Cut has become the essential version of the game, even if purely for the better optimization alone. Available for a mere £5 / $7, players who already own the game aren't risking too much when it comes to revisiting Kojima Productions' bizarre hike through America.                            
80	                                Death Stranding remains kind of ridiculous: a bloated prog rock album of a game created by a man with a large film collection, an indulgent publisher and a budget few creators could ever dream of. But out of such ostentatious ingredients, astonishing moments can occasionally arise. If you were looking for a PS5 game that informs us that, yes, near-photorealistic visuals can lift a work in more than a surface aesthetic sense, this is it. The image of the dead rising as twisted smoking shadows above the gnarled countryside is something that will live with me for a long time. It all goes to show that sometimes, it really can take a £500 games console and a multimillionaire developer with an Ultravox fixation to make magical things happen.                            
80	                                Death Stranding: Director’s Cut is easily the best version of Kojima’s latest game. The new features and additions are more than worth the $10 upgrade for existing owners. Visually the game always looked amazing, but the new higher resolution just showcases the details even better. For anyone who enjoyed the original this upgrade is easy to recommend. For those that never played it, this is the version to get. I continue to think about this game on a weekly basis and enjoyed revisiting it with the new content.                            
80	                                Featuring 4K textures, smooth frame rates, and new content that complements the core story, Death Stranding: Director's Cut tops the vanilla game in nearly every way.                            
80	                                Some of Death Stranding Director's Cut's new additions are a little disappointing, but the experience's core mechanics remain intact. Though it is an inessential purchase, those who enjoyed the original game and want to dive in again will find plenty to like here.                            
80	                                Death Stranding Director's Cut rekindles the flame for this extraordinary epic tales. The new additions allow this adventure to be seen from a new perspective. It adds new features aimed at neophytes. It is above all to them that this title is addressed. However, Hideo Kojima's teams do not forget the fans through the new action missions and the scoring table in order to push for performance and replayability. We are facing a title that is already excellent in its foundations and the new additions come to strengthen them to give an overall rendering that it would be a shame to miss out on, especially if you had not given the original version a chance.                            
80	                                If you’ve been holding off on Death Stranding in the hope they would improve it then Death Stranding Director’s Cut is the perfect time to jump in. Even outside of that though I found Death Stranding a fascinating game to be playing for the first time.                            
80	                                Overall, this is a full-to-bursting title, even bigger than the huge PS4 original. It looks astounding, sounds great and that immersive feedback in the controller brings this odd sci-fi world to life like never before. If you played the original and feel ‘done’ with it, there may not be enough big tweaks to bring you back for another go. But the upgrade price point is good and it’ll definitely appeal to those gamers who missed out on playing the original and now fancy jumping in on PS5.                            
80	                                Who is this new version of Death Stranding for? The answer is extremely simple: for those who enjoyed and appreciated the work of the father of Metal Gear. Of course, it is also a product designed for those who, at the time, overlooked it for whatever reason. If you are in this situation and you are already the proud owner of a PS5, I would tell you that this is the best opportunity to try one of the best titles of the past generation of consoles and find out for yourself why we say it is. so special. I repeat, as someone who spent several dozen hours two years ago with the game, I would have loved to have an expansion the size of Iki Island that would allow me to know more about the lives of all these characters who made me go through such good times, even so. , it was a delight to return to travel these desolate landscapes with Sam Porter Bridges.                             
80	                                Death Standing: Director’s Cut is the definitive version of the game. It’s gorgeous and runs at 60 frames per second, while including everything from the PC version. The new missions are a bit too light on content, but they round out the experience nicely.                            
80	                                More could have been done on the story front, but Death Stranding Director’s Cut is still a solid experience on the PS5.                            
80	                                I am a genuine fan of Hideo Kojima's work and Death Stranding as a whole, but the lack of substantial new content to justify the additional price of entry holds back Death Stranding Director's Cut from reaching the soaring heights it potentially could. There is maybe enough new content to keep a returning player engaged for a weekend or so, but there really isn't anything in this update that couldn't have been included in a PS5 patch. However, Death Stranding itself is a modern marvel of creativity and risk-taking that I consider a "must play" for anyone who has not yet experienced it, and the upgrades in the Director’s Cut make it the optimal way to tackle this unique journey.                            
70	                                Death Stranding: Director’s Cut is the definitive version of the game, packaging everything in and adding a whole lot more. Kojima’s unique and captivating journey across America feels like it achieves what it couldn’t on PS4, due to excellent DualSense enhancement and some meaningful updates.                            
70	                                Death Stranding Director's Cut will appeal to players who liked the original, but for everyone else there is nothing game-changing here.                            
70	                                A long list of quality of life improvements certainly makes the PS5 Director’s Cut the most feature-rich and accessible version of Death Stranding. If you’re yet to experience its gorgeous vistas and general sci-fi weirdness and you’re not turned off at the thought of a 40-hour fetch quest, then this is the best way to enjoy its fiction with the least amount of friction. However, by giving us powerful new cargo-moving tools that allow us to forgo heavily burdened hikes in favour of walking the path of least resistance, it diminishes frustration at the cost of any sense of hard-earned gratification. This may be called a “Director’s Cut,” but I can’t help but feel that, for better or worse, the PS4 original perhaps more closely resembles the director’s vision.                            
60	                                It’s hard to believe this is Hideo Kojima’s preferred version of the game, considering it side lines so much of the core gameplay and adds little else of any substance.                            
58	                                I went into Death Strand Directors Cut, ready to embrace the weird and enjoy the experience. The story, visuals and world are all quite good and up to a great standard. But before too long the monotonous nature of its core gameplay had me feeling I was doing a job that I had little interest in.                            
50	                                There's no denying Death Stranding: Director's Cut's technical achievements. It's incredibly immersive, putting every new capability built into the PlayStation 5 to the test and coming out triumphant. If you were disappointed by Death Stranding's unwieldy gameplay the first time around, the Director's Cut isn't going to win you over. But if Kojima's storytelling took you in, this will be a worthwhile upgrade.                            
100	                                It is rare when I find a game that tries to capture real people and nails it so well. Every aspect of Life is Strange: True Colors — from the dialogue to the characters to the paths they took — is real and vivid, and I fell in love with all of it almost immediately. If the ending doesn’t get people talking for the next several months, we’ve failed as a society because the entire final two chapters were impossible to look and walk away from. The game is an absolute gem and shouldn’t be overlooked.                            
100	                                You will be forced to make hard decisions and live with them as Alex Chen, some of which will have an irreversible impact on the narrative. Yet there’s no harrowing conclusion to be uncovered here. Much like real life, each revelation is a punch you must roll with, whether it’s losing a loved one or conjuring up the courage to confess your love to a crush. No matter how trivial or monumental, True Colors makes each moment matter as it forms the identity of a woman I came to care for and relate to in ways that few games have managed to achieve. This brings me back to the sibling bond between Alex and Gabe, and how it feels like a virtual replacement for the bond between myself and the brother I wasn’t able to bid farewell to. I had that chance here, and I can’t describe how much that means to me. Without being overly poetic or needlessly saccharine, I’m glad more games are engaging with how we can learn, grow, and love as human beings, and the rewards that come with accepting such hardships along the way. Life is Strange: True Colors truly is something special.                            
100	                                The best Life is Strange game yet. Through the concept of empathy, True Colors manages to drive video game storytelling to new heights. An expanded scope, hugely impressive production values and new, bingeable format make this a must-play for fans of narrative adventures.                            
100	                                I could wax lyrical about so many elements of Life is Strange: True Colors, going into detail about every tiny thing that makes its storytelling so incredible, but I won't. The narrative should be uncovered as you play it, and going in with as little knowledge as possible will make those twists and turns have that much more impact. This is without a doubt the best game in the series yet. The characterisation, the worldbuilding, the visuals, the facial animations – practically everything here is flawless. With True Colors, Deck Nine has solidified itself as the master of narrative adventure, and I can't wait to see what comes next.                            
95	                                Life is Strange: True Colors is a technically brilliant and emotionally-driven masterpiece, providing a compelling narrative wrapped around some of the best choice-based gameplay I’ve experienced in years. It also made me reflect on what my life can be if I just take a minute to let go, which isn’t something I can say about many other pieces of art or media.                             
95	                                I had waited with bated breath to play Life is Strange's next narrative adventure and I can honestly say I wasn't let down. Every expectation was met and then some. From the deeply impactful writing, the consequences of choices, and the attention to every detail, True Colors was an experience that I can't wait to start all over again.                            
95	                                Life is Strange: True Colors is another success for Deck Nine, highlighting how well they understand the source material and its connection with the audience. The new characters, location, and power are an instant classic of the series and we can only hope they continue to develop this world alongside DONTNOD.                            
90	                                Life is Strange: True Colors sets a new bar for the series. Deck Nine does a stellar job of exploring painful topics that evoke true emotion both in-game and out, using its cast of well-written characters and set pieces, all packaged within a gorgeous environment and a beautiful soundscape.                            
90	                                The end result is a remarkable, powerful game. Life is Strange: True Colors stays true to the series’ roots, using supernatural twists and an underlying mystery as the backdrop for a story that’s focused on the quiet beauty of everyday life and the connections that form between people. Within that, it carves its own path with a moving exploration of the power of empathy and the importance of finding a place to call home.                            
90	                                Life is Strange: True Colors is, without a doubt, the best in the series in my opinion. After some disappointment with Deck Nine's previous work, True Colors has managed to win over my heart and for the first time in a long while, care for a narrative driven game like this one.                            
90	                                Life is Strange: True Colors is a rumination on loss, empathy, and finding your place in the word. A great cast is bolstered by improved visuals, animations, and a truly remarkable protagonist in Alex Chen, making this the true highlight of the series.                            
90	                                Life is Strange True Colors has everything that fans of rich storytelling will love: a varied cast of characters, an intriguing setting to explore, and the chance the affect the overall outcome of what happens, putting the storytelling right into the player’s hands. While at times the game does feel slightly more linear than previous titles and plot points can feel rehashed, it’ll keep you coming back to the town of Haven Springs time and time again. It’s a game about walking to the beat of your own drum — we’re all on a journey of self-discovery and emotion, and Life is Strange True Colors reflects that to its core.                            
90	                                Deck Nine and Square Enix took a gamble when ditching the episodic blueprint for Life is Strange: True Colors. But the decision has paid off, delivering one of the series’ more refined entries to date, and one that isn’t hampered by needless padding. Even though it’s held back slightly by one too many glitches, Haven Springs is a joy to explore, and Alex’s journey of grief and the importance of expressing your emotions is one that will stay with me for a long time to come.                            
90	                                These small flaws aside, True Colors is tugs at your heartstrings and doesn’t let go until its credits roll. It’s a wholesome game that covers some deep subject matter, but gives it to you in a way that makes for an enjoyable viewing and gaming experience. Fans of the series will love how familiar it feels to the other games, but everyone will appreciate how mature its themes are that continue to emphasize the uniqueness and unexpectedness life can bring – superpowers in hand or not.                            
90	                                Life Is Strange: True Colors is right up there as one of the best games in the series, if not the outright best. Its characters are interestingly complex and believable, the writing is strong — albeit a bit clichéd in true Life Is Strange fashion — and its more sinister narrative has plenty of twists and turns that’ll keep you hooked. It’s all punctuated by heartwarming, lighthearted sections reminiscent of Before the Storm’s beloved ‘play’ scene, and its decisions will have you second-guessing yourself for hours. The whole experience is wrapped up in the strongest presentation values and a soundtrack that never skips a beat. This is a must-play for fans of the series, and a serious contender for my Game of the Year.                             
90	                                Life is Strange: True Colors is exactly what Deck Nine meant it to be. It's difficult, even when you know exactly how someone feels to say the right thing, encourage the right path, and keep hold of your own emotions too. It's tender but funny. It's cheesy yet sincere. And those of you that loved the original Life is Strange will likely love this, too.                             
90	                                When Alex experiences joy for the first time, a warm golden glow emanates from the characters, sparkling and twisting into the laughter-filled air. Life Is Strange: True Colors fills my heart with the same sensation. Then breaks it in the most bittersweet way I could imagine. Alex’s story is a colourful tapestry, stitched together with the gossamer thread of what it means to be human. It’s a glimmering, supernatural journey that reminds you life really is… weird.                            
90	                                The writers from Deck Nine and DONTNOD have demonstrated that their gift is not unlike Alex's. They have an empathy and understanding of the struggles that humans face. Life is Strange: True Colors builds on what the first installment did well, and does it even better. No game in the series so far has reached this height of catharsis, and by the end of it, players will be heartbroken to leave the imperfectly perfect town of Haven Springs.                            
90	                                Life is Strange: Colors effectively leads you through an emotionally impactful story with strong character development through the power of empathy                            
90	                                Life is Strange: True Colors is an emotional rollercoaster that highlights everything that makes the series great.                            
90	                                Life Is Strange: True Colors is an incredible new addition to the series. It brings perhaps the most likeable protagonist yet, the absolutely gorgeous Haven Springs, and an excellent supporting cast together for an intensely emotional but hopeful tale. With enough gorgeous sweeping cinematic shots to put an indie film to shame, and some absolutely incredible writing, Alex’s journey is something you must experience.                            
90	                                While the original game remains a touchstone for me, Life is Strange: True Colors is the best iteration the series has seen yet. The narrative adventure also betters the diversity the franchise is already beloved for, providing an exceptional hero in an authentic, badass Asian-American woman that can be LGBTQ+ (should they so choose it). Filled to the brim with narrative and character twists at every turn, this is a game that made me laugh, cry and fall in love. With moments that hit like a bullet train, Life is Strange: True Colors is a must-play. Jump on in and feel all the feelings, friends. You'll be glad you did.                            
90	                                Life is Strange: True Colors grapples with some heavy emotions -- literally and figuratively -- and manages to stick the landing more often than not. The various chapters range from fine to great, with more being somewhere just above good than not. Its choices felt meaningful, its dialogue largely heartfelt, and I’m still thinking about the ending days later. It’d be easy to boil the game down to being a glorified empathy simulator, but the reality is that Life is Strange: True Colors is more complicated, more beautifully complex than that. And for a game in part about the manifestation of emotional resonance, it does end up being emotionally resonant. It’s hard to ask for more than the delivery on that promise.                            
90	                                Though Life is Strange: True Colors isn’t as action-heavy as previous games, its relaxed atmosphere, witty writing, and visual upgrades easily put it on par with the best of the franchise.                            
90	                                Life is Strange: True Colors is a fantastic slice of life from an idealized alternate universe. Alex is an excellent protagonist, and her adventures with her attractive, funny friends in their beautiful town is a great way to spend about twelve hours.                             
90	                                At times funny, exciting, mysterious, and heartbreaking, Life Is Strange: True Colors made me fall in love with this little town and all of those who live there. I hope this isn’t the last we see of Alex. A character this wonderful deserves many adventures to come.                            
88	                                Life is Strange: True Colors catches up with the original Life is Strange on a narrative level and, unsurprisingly, improves the experience with superior graphics quality, remarkable voice acting, and a beautiful soundtrack. Once stepped out of the bus, it will be easy to totally identify with Alex and be carried away not only by her search for truth but also, more simply, by the everyday life and warmth that only a place like Haven Springs can offer.                            
85	                                Life is Strange: True Colors is a must-play for anyone with even the vaguest interest in the series. It takes everything that has made the franchise good and elevates it to new heights. This is Life is Strange at its most confident, its most sentimental, and its most engrossing.                            
85	                                Life is Strange: True Colors offers a solid narrative with many options to unlock and a mystery to solve. Yes, it sounds like more of the same, but the investigation and the story development through the perception and emotions of others make this a unique and enjoyable experience. Even with its flaws, you will enjoy the new Deck Nine game.                            
85	                                True Colors’ writing is so strong that it didn’t need a supernatural ability to tell this story. I laughed, I cried, and the things that stick with me are the moments where Alex is tested and comes into her own. And there’s something special in how True Colors gives you the power to decide her future and what her life needs, making for a memorable ending with a highlight reel of what you envision for the character. Due to all branching choice variations, you can probably get in a few different playthroughs, but the overall message never changes: Don’t give up. It may be a well-worn saying, but it means a lot in Alex Chen’s pained life.                             
85	                                Life is Strange: True Colors is an incredibly endearing game, with a wonderful cast of characters and the charming town of Haven Springs proving to be a standout. Some narrative hiccups were not enough to stop this game from resonating with me, and one of my only complaints is that it was over all too soon.                             
83	                                Technically speaking the best entry in the series, Life is Strange: True Colors takes up and improves the path traced by Dontnod with the original Life is Strange.                            
83	                                Life is Strange: True Colors is a unique game, unlike anything I have played before. It is a departure from the other titles in the series, while also retaining the soul of what made people enjoy those games so much. With a stronger focus on interpersonal relationships and genuinely empathizing with those around you (both friend and foe), it feels like the series is finding its footing and pushing forward to bigger and better things. The decision to switch from the episodic format to a full upfront release pays off and I think Life is Strange: True Colors is much better for it. Once I got invested in the story, I did not want to stop playing, and I think a lot of the decisions and connections you make would start to lose their meaning if there were an extended break in between chapters.                            
80	                                Life is Strange: True Colors is a complete title that will take around nine to ten hours to finish. This might prove a bit steep for the price, but the pacing and character work do well to make this story worth the time. The colourful visuals compliment Alex's power, but there are a few rough patches along the way. Despite the soundtrack of original and licensed songs blending into the world, the Live Stream mode is half baked and should be revisited in the future because as a shared experience; this game shines with complexion.                            
80	                                Haven Springs will work its charm on you. Alex Chen is easy to root for and her story is well worth playing for Life is Strange series fans and newbies alike. [Issue#6, p.78]                            
80	                                True Colors is a worthy continuation of the franchise. Releasing all the episodes at the same time was a good call, since you can go through the story in one sitting, offering around 8 hours’ worth of emotional journey. It is not perfect, and it would have deserved a more elaborate ending. It cannot be as emotional as Before the Storm or as important as the first game, but it keeps the best parts of its predecessors and adds some new elements that fit seamlessly in the mix. It is mandatory for all the fans of the series and a must try for those who think video games should be about much more than just shooting and explosions.                            
80	                                Life is Strange: True Colors has the best characters in the whole series, but at the same time, it also has the weakest story. The narrative takes way too long to take off, and by that time, it might already be too late for many players.                             
80	                                True Colors is worth exploring in its entirety, but it glosses over the rougher parts of life, painting them in a romantic light.                            
80	                                While Telltale has shut down and Life is Strange isn’t the surprise hipster hit it was in 2015, True Colors shows that there are plenty of themes, characters, and superpowers for developers to explore in the future.                            
80	                                Life is Strange: True Colors is an excellent entry in the series, and a great place to jump in for newcomers. Some technical issues can’t be overlooked now that it’s a full-priced title, but it’s something that seems easily fixable with a patch or two. Alex Chen is an incredibly endearing character that asks us to face our grief and empathize with other people’s struggles, reminding us of our shared human experience.                            
80	                                A charming addition to the Life Is Strange franchise that has one of the best branching narratives in any video game and one of the most likeable set of characters.                            
80	                                Life is Strange: True Colors is the largest and most ambitious chapter in the Square-Enix series, but it does not reach the narrative depth of the previous chapters.                             
80	                                There’s no denying that Life Is Strange: True Colors does things a little differently from previous games while retaining that signature look and feel that we’ve come to expect from the series. Overall, it’s a solid effort from Deck Nine and a considerable step up from their last take on the series, Before The Storm.                            
80	                                Life Is Strange: True Colors sets out to explore the concept of empathy and it succeeds. The game is able to discuss and handle many serious topics with care while also managing to tell a meaningful story of loss and acceptance. The game introduces one of the best protagonists in the franchise yet and excels in its core gameplay mechanics.                            
80	                                Life is Strange: True Colors presents a great adventure in this beloved series with significant choices and player-driven interactions. The result is a beautiful story of empathy and new beginnings where players have the freedom to shape the narrative the way they want and deal with the consequences along the way. The character animations and voiced dialogue only elevate it to new levels of quality, but long loading times and strange responses can hurt the pacing tremendously.                            
80	                                With Life is Strange: True Colors, Deck Nine has recreated with faithfulness the "Dontnod formula", so if you are looking for a story about the weight of emotions, putting the spotlight on the things that matters and with lots of hard decisions... Don't look any further.                            
80	                                Outside of a few flaws, True Colors is the peak of the Life is Strange series to date.                            
80	                                Life is Strange: True Colors is the third installment of the award-winning saga conceived by Dontnod but it is the first one developed by Deck Nine Games. Right from the start you will be highly captivated by the story of Alex Chen and Haven Springs. Too bad only for some problems related to the narrative rhythm that do not allow the game to make the definitive leap in quality that it deserves.                            
80	                                Life is Strange: True Colors is a lovely tale about empathy, self-acceptance and humanity. Probability it's not the most original or neither the neatest one, but it's something that we probably need these days.                            
76	                                Life is Strange: True Colors presents a tale of empathy as you witness a town struggle to deal with a tragic event. I enjoyed my time in Haven, especially when seeing the world through the eyes of different characters and the ending presented an interesting twist. However, it's all over quickly and the mystery-solving portion is lackluster but it's an ultimately rewarding experience.                            
75	                                Another interesting story, supported by believable characters and excellent voice-acting. It’s a shame the graphics aren’t always up to par. The current-gen optimalization also needs some improvement.                             
75	                                Life is Strange: True Colors is not a perfect game and it is difficult to compare it with its predecessors, since each one is special and has a totally different approach. It can be classified as the most mature of the saga, although it has some problems when it comes to dealing with the psychological factor surrounding the protagonist.                            
70	                                In its best moments (of which there are plenty), this is about as good as Life is Strange has ever been. [Issue#364, p.112]                            
70	                                A modern narrative adventure game with an amazingly lovable heroine and plenty of strong scenes. But it’s also a tad too ambitious in scope. It looks great, sounds great and its story holds together for the most part, so in the end, you should probably play it. Just not on consoles!                            
70	                                Bursting with color, and well acted, but also a bit to short and clumsy at times.                            
70	                                There is light that developer Deck Nine just never allows darkness to touch, and there is joy to be had in being able to play some small part in making sure they all do better. But the disconnect between that vibe and the turmoil that brought Alex here to begin with is tangible, and the game would achieve brilliance if those two concerns could connect. Dropping by Haven Springs is still time well-spent--but it's simply a pleasant visit, rather than a powerful, emotionally resonant one.                            
70	                                True Colors is the best game in the series since Before the Storm, and it will satisfy your narrative craving for a time.                            
70	                                There isn’t an easy way to recommend Life is Strange: True Colors. It, like the rest of the Life is Strange franchise, isn’t a typical game. It’s more akin to a visual novel or point-and-click adventure. The game is a slow, enjoyable experience, perfect for when you want to wind down for the night or get up in the morning. More than that, though, it’s an emotional triumph. Experiencing Alex’s adventure and seeing the world through her excellently crafted perspective is a joy that hit me harder than I expected it to.                             
70	                                Life Is Strange: True Colors is worth your time, and is a title you don't want to miss. Just be ready to put the controller down at the start of fifth chapter, and pretend that the game ends at this exact point.                            
70	                                Life is Strange: True Colors is an experience that can be appreciated in the sweetness of its journey, sublimated by shimmering colors, animations more accomplished than ever and very beautiful melodies. With this episode, Deck Nine Games chose to explore empathy from top to bottom; a preponderant aspect in the powers granted, the narration and the construction of the characters. The whole provides a very neat adventure on a human level, but which undeniably lacks a certain liveliness in its actions and the unfolding of the plot. The result is an investigation that lacks a certain panache.                             
60	                                Life is Strange: True Colors might feature grown-up characters, but it's evident the franchise itself still has a bit of growing to do. Deck Nine tries and ultimately fails to tell a story of emotional healing at best. At worst, it treats difficult topics with a flippant callousness that suggests it doesn't quite understand how to deal with these emotions to begin with, let alone tell a meaningful story about healing and moving on.                            
60	                                Life is Strange: True Colors is a game that constantly aims higher, but never really takes off. Neither the power, nor the story, nor the environment are up to its greatest virtue, which is none other than Alex Chen, its main character. The good ideas are weighed down by the timidity of a game that does not end up betting on its own proposals. There are things to rescue, it has a good rhythm, and it is easy to get into, but it is within the best installments of the franchise.                            
60	                                Interactive possibilities make this dorky tale about a small-town psychic musician strangely absorbing.                            
60	                                Life Is Strange: True Colors had every chance of becoming the series' best game to date, but it's been let down by arguably its most important element: the story. Wonderful character work can only go so far carrying a narrative that just isn't particularly exciting. And while Alex's power crafts one interesting scenario after another, it too isn't enough to offset those dull plot points. With an awful framerate to boot, Life Is Strange: True Colors falls short despite everything it has going for it.                            
60	                                Life is Strange: True Colors has a lot of the ingredients that make the series so beloved, most notably in its compelling protagonist. Technical advancements for the series bring its story to life with fantastic performances and a keen eye for detail. Unfortunately, the story it brings to life is full of stutters and stops, and takes far too long to develop. Where Life is Strange games are full of movement, True Colors feels painfully stagnant for too long.                            
40	                                True Colors doesn’t show the world in a new light so much as it slaps an Instagram filter over it.                            
92	                                Even 30 years after release, Final Fantasy IV still shines as brightly as it did in 1991. Its genre-defining story and combat system coupled with the Pixel Remaster’s reorchestrated soundtrack and quality of life updates make this an iconic game you’d be a fool to miss. Much like Cecil struggles with his unwitting role as a killer for his king, I struggle to let go of Final Fantasy IV Pixel Remaster after spending a few dozen hours wrapping up its main quest. If you have even a modicum of affection for JRPGs, you will too.                            
90	                                Final Fantasy IV was a great game when it came out in 1991, and, 30 years later, Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster is just as great. The only thing, in my opinion, that could have made this game better would have been the inclusion of the Lunar Subterrain from Final Fantasy IV Advance. But, hey, “almost perfect” is still pretty good, too. Whether you’re a Final Fantasy veteran or are looking to get your feet wet, I can’t recommend Final Fantasy IV Pixel Remaster enough.                            
90	                                Final Fantasy IV Pixel Remaster is a nigh-definitive rebuild of an essential entry in the series, revitalized with a new presentation and only lacking the bonus endgame content of other ports.                            
90	                                Final Fantasy IV is one of the best 16-bit RPGs with a strong story that holds up after all these years. Even though the turn-based combat and exploration with random encounters may seem simple compared to modern games, it’s still an enjoyable fourteen hour playthrough. This may not have been the remake everyone was hoping for, but Final Fantasy IV Pixel Remaster is a great version of a great game.                            
80	                                While the Final Fantasy Pixel Remasters aren’t perfect, they’re certainly the best and most convenient ways to play these classic games. The soundtracks are lovingly orchestrated and the pixel art is gorgeous, though the latter does lose some detail in the translation. Each game feels great to play, but I do wish extra content from previous releases or remakes had been included.                            
80	                                It’s not being weak to pounce on Final Fantasy IV once again. Introducing a dramatic dimension that was lacking in the first episodes of the saga, this adventure crosses the generations without taking a wrinkle. For this Pixel Remaster iteration, Square-Enix remains true to its line of conduct, finding an interesting balance between past and present. Charming and exciting, the game would however have deserved more significant bonuses, such as a small making-of for example. Some may be closed to this less flashy approach than the PSP episode, but Final Fantasy IV, for all that it stands for, remains a staple in Japanese RPGs.                             
80	                                Final Fantasy IV Pixel Remaster may initially butt up against your nostalgia if you have fond memories of the original, but over time, I really began to appreciate seeing its visuals and sound explored in creative ways.                            
78	                                Final Fantasy IV Pixel Remaster is an updated version of a 30-year-old game that stays true to its roots. A great entry point for those interested in the history of the series.                            
100	                                Jurassic Park Evolution 2 delivers improvements across the board. It takes the best parts of the original game, adds new ways to play, and changes up mechanics to make them feel more realistic and interesting - making everything more engaging and immersive. Building straight paths and fences is easier, keeping dinosaurs fed is a breeze, and even speeding up time is now possible, yet managing those raptors is still a welcome challenge. While I may not actually be the best dinosaur supervisor yet, I can’t see myself putting this game down for a long time.                             
95	                                Whether you’re a seasoned Jurassic World Evolution player or brand new to the franchise, I can guarantee you that you will have a blast with Jurassic World Evolution 2. While I think a couple of things could be tweaked to make certain things more obvious, it doesn’t stop you from having an absolutely wonderful time playing the game. The addition of the flying and aquatic dinosaurs has been excellent, and I really hope for more content and DLC to go along with it!                            
90	                                Jurassic World Evolution 2 is endless fun for a fan of the blockbuster franchise. A large library of species to unlock and study, bioengineering, and the ability to revisit iconic moments from the movies makes it an easy recommendation for anyone looking for their fix of Jurassic content. Even as a park manager, the game is quite satisfying, aside from some light frustrations here or there.                            
90	                                Taking the time to name your dinosaurs and seeing them interact in their immersive enclosures creates a certain unmistakable bond that will have you yelling through your screen at your scaley children to get along. Losing your first dinosaur to a trial by combat is equally as emotional after you’ve invested so much time into their health and well-being. However, every new dinosaur you create is a chance to take a small mental break from park management. They each have different behaviors, sounds, and habits to observe, so take that time to zip around the enclosures and watch your dilos “Pinky” and “Brain” take a nap in the tall grass: they’re kind of cute when they’re asleep.                            
90	                                Jurassic World: Evolution 2 brings some cool new features and content to the table that elevates it over its predecessor. The story campaign is a bit short and lacks in a compelling narrative and challenge. But the Chaos Theory missions make more than up for that. The increased complexity and depth in a lot of game systems are exactly what the game needed. And in the end the game draws a lot from the unbowed fascination for dinosaurs.                            
85	                                Jurassic World Evolution 2 is well worth the money. It’s an expansive game that has a little bit of everything for everyone without skipping a beat. There is nostalgia, challenge, and just pure fun. You get science and you get entertainment park, and a lot more. I can say, having put nearly 100 hours into Jurassic World Evolution, picking up the sequel feels like a new experience.                            
82	                                A real evolution of the original, Jurassic World Evolution 2 brings a lot of new contents and deepens its simulation structure to reach another level of complexity and richness.                            
80	                                In short, Jurassic World Evolution 2 is better in every way than its predecessor, which was already a good game, but lacked possibilities when it was released. This second opus opens up directly to air and sea species while offering players many more management tools and different game modes. We regret the lack of balancing on the difficulty which will put off occasional players and the fact that the sandbox mode is not complete. A very good vintage that will get even better with time and that will bring back the nostalgia of the successful movies about these majestic creatures that once populated the earth, the sky and our oceans.                            
80	                                If a few additions strengthen the depth of the game a little, such as scientists or territory management, others are a little more cumbersome without being unduly disturbing. If we would have liked more clear-cut news, we once again had a great time on Jurassic World Evolution 2, for a good twenty hours.                             
80	                                Selecting a dinosaur zooms the camera in from the top-down, god’s-eye-view to track it as it plods around its enclosure, grazing, drinking from a watering hole or occasionally battling a member of the pack for dominance. Each dinosaur comes with a multimillion year history including detailed accounts of what it ate and where it lived. Even though you’re sat in your living room, Frontier Developments’ magic is in transporting us – through lifelike animations, through snuffling grunts, through the soppy look in a stegosaurus’s eyes – to where we all wanted to be in 1993: standing in a real Jurassic Park, watching these impossibly majestic creatures.                            
80	                                Jurassic World Evolution 2 is not a bad game, not at all, as a matter of fact, those that already played the first entry are going to love this one, and the players that make of this one their first contact with the saga are going to be overjoyed as well. The gameplay itself is awesome, and the overall experience is pretty funny, nevertheless, it certainly lacks something regarding new elements.                             
80	                                Jurassic World Evolution 2 is chaotic, delightful proof that managing dinosaurs is no walk in the Jurassic park.                             
80	                                Jurassic World Evolution was good, Jurassic World Evolution 2 is better. Most problems that arose in the original are addressed in the sequel, and many systems are improved. The first campaign mode is the weakest part of the game, despite an interesting premise.                            
80	                                Fun building sim with numerous improvements over its predecessor. Thedinosaurs are still the main attraction.                            
75	                                The evolution is noticeable - Jurassic World Evolution 2 is a better game than its predecessor. The gameplay is more complex, the graphics are nicer, there are new game modes, and some of the changes show that the developer has really listened to the community. There are still ways to go, but the direction is good.                             
75	                                Jurassic World Evolution 2 is a visually gorgeous game marred by a very bad case of micromanagement excess. Dinosaurs are great, there is a lot of content and the overall idea is very good, but there is just to much busywork being forced upon the player to enjoy the experience fully.                            
72	                                The constant threat of chaos adds tension and fun to an otherwise basic management sim.                            
70	                                While I can't quite endorse Jurassic World Evolution 2 as a robust park management sim, the area where it puts its main focus – the dinosaurs! – is engaging. Being able to hop into a tour looping around the raptor enclosure or taking direct control of a ranger team rushing to stop a catastrophic escape attempt during a raging storm creates a lot of the exact, awesome moments I want out of a modern Jurassic Park game. Especially compared to its frustratingly shallow predecessor, Jurassic World Evolution 2, uh, found a way.                            
70	                                Improves on its predecessor in clever ways and still boasts the most gorgeous dinosaurs ever made in a game. But dealing with disastrous events beyond your control still isn't any fun, even if it's thematic for the Jurassic Park IP.                            
65	                                Jurassic World Evolution 2 feels like home for long time fans, but the simulation isn't deep enough to make you actually fall in love with the game and its core gameplay loop.                            
50	                                Jurassic World Evolution 2, for all the negative things I’ve had to say about it, is not in itself that bad of a game. It IS however, a mediocre Jurassic Park game, one that has passable mechanics that gel with the franchise about as well as a raptor gels with Samuel L. Jackson. Ultimately, you can’t really look past such an enormous missing of the point and it does besmirch the experience. For diehard Jurassic Park fans like me, the Jurassic World Evolution formula is a hard sell, though park management enthusiasts may get a kick out of this still.                            
50	                                Jurassic World Evolution 2 offers much the same dinosaur park-building experience as its predecessor, but the inclusion of the new avian and marine dinosaurs adds depth and creates new opportunities for players to expand their dream park. Chaos Theory is a similarly brilliant concept that puts players in control to change the outcomes of their favorite Jurassic Park and Jurassic World films. Unfortunately, even with these notable additions, gameplay can begin to feel repetitive and shallow in both the lackluster Campaign and the multiple Challenge modes, and the locked options preventing players from exercising their creativity in Sandbox mode from the start may turn off fans of Frontier's other park-builder sims like Planet Coaster and Planet Zoo. As it is now, it's difficult to recommend Jurassic World Evolution 2 because, despite some great new ideas, the execution feels potentially alienating for its target audience.                            
85	                                Ultimately, The Caligula Effect 2 is not a game for everyone. This is something the developers are keenly aware of. It’s not a flashy, high-budget, big-name, auteur-laden, AAA RPG that’s gone through the gauntlet of playtesters and focus groups. It’s a scrappy, low-budget underdog that’s full of heart and empathy, and it has a message to share. Though the game is a sequel, those interested can certainly start with this version, as its predecessor is vaguely recapped. For the few like myself who enjoyed the original game despite its numerous flaws, this follow-up is a dramatic glow up that deserves to be played. It is easily one of my favorite games this year.                            
70	                                Like the Matrix déjà vu, this sequel smells of the original. Changes are very subtle and ultimately mean a different cast in a similar setting. While the graphics are fairly poor and suggest a low-cost production, everything else makes a pretty decent if not excellent combination of fun mechanics and likeable characters. If you loved the first game, this one's for you.                            
70	                                The biggest tell of how much of an improvement The Caligula Effect 2 is over its predecessor is how little of the game feels like a chore. Although it may lack those standout moments that top-drawer RPGs provide, it’s easy to find time whizzing by with catchy music and speedy combat and exploration. With characters and a story that keep things ticking along nicely, The Caligula Effect 2 makes for a satisfying use of one’s time.                            
70	                                If you loved The Caligula Effect, chances are you’ll love The Caligula Effect 2 even more. It’s certainly an improvement across the board, with a story that will keep you invested for the duration. Newcomers, however, might be put off by the references to the first game, and also may not gel very well with the relationship-building aspects that aren’t all that rewarding or interesting. Overall, there’s a lot to like about The Caligula Effect 2, but it’s accompanied by a fair bit of tedium.                            
68	                                The soul of the title, completely conservative, draws heavily from the material of the first chapter of the series, updating it only up to a certain point and never fully convincing: the solution certainly manages to satisfy the fans who already appreciated the experience. five years ago on PlayStation Vita, but struggling to convince everyone else. The sector is full of similar productions, much more inspired and cared for: both from the point of view of the gameplay (which also shows some creative flashes) and from the graphic-technical one, the latter really mediocre. Of course, the narrative itself might attract some curious: the conflict between the virtual and the real world, for some reason, is always captivating.                            
67	                                A good combat system and a infectious soundtrack are not enough to make The Caligula Effect 2 a recommendation. What we have here is much better than the first game, but not on par with the best JRPGs on the market. Still, fans of the genre may want to give it a try.                            
66	                                The Caligula Effect 2 has not too much to offer apart from a good combat system and some interesting artistic vibes. The game is a very classic JRPG technically wise far from the modern standards, which suffers from a quite frayed and monotonous rhythm.                            
65	                                The Caligula Effect 2 is a game that deserved a better budget than it got. It’s combat system is amazing and engaging, but everything else about it could be better.                            
60	                                The Caligula Effect 2 has loads of cool ideas, but it's undeniably rough around the edges. The visuals and character models are basic, animations can be awkward, and the environmental design comes off as uninspired. At least the user interface looks lovely.                            
60	                                The Caligula Effect 2 is an improvement on its predecessor, most notably regarding the narrative and cast. However, it still has some kinks to iron out with the battle system and side quest structure. If a third game ever happens, and developer Aquaria can keep up the improved storytelling and characters while also continuing to polish its weaker areas, it has the potential to become a JRPG worthy of being recommended along with other titanic peers in the genre.                            
60	                                The Caligula Effect 2 is an interesting game but it has too many imperfections that make it uninvolving.                            
50	                                All of this could be pretty much forgiven if the game offered a quick dose of eccentric JRPG fun, but our biggest issue is with the pacing. Elements outstay their welcome before even getting anywhere. The narrative (with frequently bloated dialogue) is painfully slow, and even its Imaginary Chain battle gimmick2drags. While the idea of previewing your characters’ moves and shuffling them around so they interact like layering tracks in an audio mixer is thematically on point and great in theory, you’ll probably find yourself mashing (X) or using auto-battle just to save some time. You can teach an old musician new songs, but that doesn’t mean they’ll be a hit. [Issue#8, p.90]                            
50	                                The Caligula Effect 2 is the kind of experience that works on paper, with a good basic idea and potentially intriguing protagonists. The game, however, is a hymn to banality and boredom without any redeeming traits. Fans (?) of the first game, with which it shares a weak narrative link, might find this game interesting. Everyone else should stay away.                            
100	                                I have a lot of feelings about this game, and I’m not even sure that I’m finished processing them yet. I’m going to need to play it again. But for now, I do know that this game is powerful, and it’s going to hold its own special place in my heart for a long time.                            
95	                                Life Is Strange: True Colors is an unforgettable journey with some meaningful messages.                            
92	                                Set in an idyllic town, amongst the harmony of nature, Life is Strange: True Colors might appear to be an escapist fantasy. But it has something to say. Subtly, and most importantly effectively, it reflects its characters and themes onto the player. It’s a timely reminder of the importance of empathy, and an adventure that ultimately kept me glued to it from start to finish.                            
90	                                True Colors makes an extremely strong case for the best Life Is Strange game yet, with an affecting story that tackles themes such as loss and belonging and featuring the series' most likeable protagonist to date in Alex Chen. The town of Haven Springs is also a standout, and by the end of the game, I was sad that I had to say goodbye to the cast of characters. Hopefully this isn't the last time we see Alex.                            
90	                                Somehow the team over at Deck Nine has taken the franchise to the next level. Life is Strange: True Colors is an experience that can resonate at an emotional level that's rarely seen nowadays, delivered with both maturity and grace. You'd have to be crazy to miss out on this epic adventure in small town, America.                            
90	                                Life is Strange: True Colors is a powerful story of loss, love, and overcoming the things that hold you back. The empathy abilities add depth, and Alex is one of the best characters Life is Strange has ever seen.                            
86	                                Visually gorgeous and emotionally raw, True Colors is an incredible continuation of the Life is Strange series.                            
85	                                With Dontnod, there’s always a small town and the death of a friend to get the story rolling. But this time around, characters, plot and setting are far more developed than in previous games. [Issue#255, p.62]                            
85	                                With its rich emotional proposal, Life is Strange: True Colors managed to arouse our empathy on many occasions. Even if it is not free of flaws (repetitions, invisible walls, long loading times...), it knows how to create the right atmosphere by relying on melancholic music and good acting. Its concept of auras works perfectly and allows for some very nice sequences. With its neat graphics, its excellent voice acting and its endearing characters, it is a great Life is Strange.                            
85	                                What True Colors lacks in the emotional gut-wrench that the previous games have, it makes it for with a refined format that presents a story that fits right into the series and tells it in the best way seen so far. You're very unlikely to be disappointed here.                            
83	                                There is a vast rainbow of greatness within Life is Strange: True Colors. Its awesome characters, emotional connections, effective humor, intricate animations, fun moments, and outstanding music are why it is one of the best narrative adventure games in years.                            
82	                                Life is Strange: True Colors is a really successful production with the emotions and great atmosphere that it feels to the player.                            
82	                                An extraordinary narrative adventure game that will stay in your memoryfor a long time, but it would have benefited from more interactivity.                            
80	                                While Alex’s story didn’t have the most action in it, it was full of emotion and it was a story worth telling. I give this one five stars out of five when it comes to its narrative, but I drop it down a notch to four stars out of five because of the clunky movement and too-familiar gameplay. I’m looking forward to what Dontnod and Deck Nine can do with next-generation platforms and the future Unreal Engine. But for now, they fell just a little short of what I was hoping for.                            
80	                                Life is Strange: True Colors is a fun entry in the franchise. It doesn't really break any rules or do anything shocking, but it's a comfortable game to play. The time I spent in Haven Springs put me in a shockingly good mood for a game revolving around a murder, and I welcomed the entire experience. Unfortunately, the tacked-on murder mystery drags down the story somewhat and keeps it from reaching the highest highs that it can. If you're a fan of the franchise, you're sure to like this latest entry.                            
80	                                Of the Life is Strange games I've completed (2 is still woefully unfinished for me atm), True Colors is my favorite. It strikes the perfect balance of focus on Alex as a person, the town of Haven Springs as a community, and how the two interact and change each other. While I'm still not sold on the superpowers as a mechanic or narrative device, they're unobtrusive enough to be fine, and do provide more to actually do besides walking around, looking at things and talking to people. If you liked previous entries in the Life is Strange series, you'll probably enjoy this one. It's a tighter, cleaner take on the formula, but at its heart, it's still the balance of magic and mundane that’s become signature to these games.                            
80	                                Life is Strange: True Colors struggles to justify some of its earlier chapters, but makes up for it with strong characters and a fun LARP session to mix up the gameplay. Though it doesn't quite live up to the mystery and intrigue of the original game, True Colors still shines on its own.                            
80	                                Its story doesn't quite stick the landing, but this is a beautiful game - not just in its look, sound, and feel, or even in its real and relatable characters, but in its message and its delivery.                            
80	                                True Colors is a big step up for the series and shows that Life is Strange is in good hands with Deck Nine.                            
80	                                Deck Nine Games perfectly takes over from Dondnod, keeping the narrative formula intact and upgrading the licence technically. Important choices will be made, with a true reflection on mourning and the meaning of the word Home. A great game.                            
75	                                True Colors doesn’t try to reinvent the wheel (or do anything new at all, actually), but if you have enjoyed previous entries in the series you will like this emotional journey.                            
70	                                Life is Strange: True Colors is the newest addition to the Life is Strange universe. This time, the special power of main character Alex is her talent to sense the emotions of others. The presentation is quite charming, the characters are well-written and the story is exciting, if not predictable. Unfortunately, the gameplay is quite boring and we encountered some technical problems.                             
70	                                There is light that developer Deck Nine just never allows darkness to touch, and there is joy to be had in being able to play some small part in making sure they all do better. But the disconnect between that vibe and the turmoil that brought Alex here to begin with is tangible, and the game would achieve brilliance if those two concerns could connect. Dropping by Haven Springs is still time well-spent--but it's simply a pleasant visit, rather than a powerful, emotionally resonant one.                            
70	                                Life is Strange: True Colors is an experience that can be appreciated in the sweetness of its journey, sublimated by shimmering colors, animations more accomplished than ever and very beautiful melodies. With this episode, Deck Nine Games chose to explore empathy from top to bottom; a preponderant aspect in the powers granted, the narration and the construction of the characters. The whole provides a very neat adventure on a human level, but which undeniably lacks a certain liveliness in its actions and the unfolding of the plot. The result is an investigation that lacks a certain panache.                             
67	                                True Colors is the most “alive” Life is Strange so far thanks to a technological leap, but it lacks spark and tries to compensate for it by referencing or imitating the original game.                            
100	                                For anyone new or returning to the Pokémon series, Brilliant Diamond & Shining Pearl is a perfect starting point that bridges the gap between classic and modern Pokémon games. The quality-of-life additions make the game more accessible without making it feel bloated, the art style is simplistic and cute, and the gameplay mechanics will keep players moving through the adventure with ease. For veterans of the series, these versions are an easy recommendation and an excellent recreation of a fan favorite. With only a few exclusive Pokémon between Brilliant Diamond & Shining Pearl, either one is an excellent choice for any player.                            
90	                                It’s been a long time since players have gotten to revisit Sinnoh, and all things considered this may be the definitive way to enjoy it. While some changes may seem minor, they really do add to the overall enjoyment experience. Sinnoh was always fun but flawed, and while that’s still a teensy bit true here, it’s better than ever before. Although it’s easy to say it’s a shame that it’s missing the Platinum content, what’s here is still fantastic and will make it more fun to replay for years to come. Sinnoh fans will hopefully be excited to see their region well taken care of while they were gone, and new players can easily enjoy it without having to pick up old systems and cartridges that are now significantly more expensive. Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl are the best remakes we’ve gotten since Heart Gold and Soul Silver and offer up a fantastic, faithful yet slightly re-imagined version of Sinnoh to enjoy before the next entry in the series makes its debut.                            
90	                                I've had an absolute blast with Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl, and I know there's plenty more for me to see thanks to their sheer size. With changes that lean mostly toward quality of life improvements, this is a firm reminder that Pokémon games can be extraordinary and one of the most enjoyable remakes I've played in a long time.                             
90	                                Pokemon Brilliant Diamond is like a warm hug, offering nothing but smiles and enjoyment throughout. Long term fans will find the quality of life changes make it even easier, but nonetheless, it's an otherwise faithful remake and a joy from start to finish.                            
86	                                Quotation forthcoming.                            
85	                                Overall, Pokemon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl are a must-play. Despite the chibi-style graphics feeling wacky in places, the gameplay overall is fantastic. The changes to the Grand Underground are incredible, offering up a wider selection of Pokemon early on, and Exp. Share really isn’t an issue. Even if you played the original games, BDSP offers many new features to the point where it feels like a new experience. And we won’t spoil it, but the post-game is something all veteran fans will absolutely love, especially if you like battles…and Platinum.                            
85	                                While it feels like Game Freak have been trying to find their footing with Pokémon over the last few years, Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl are a confident showing by ILCA that proves the series is far from dead. The classic formula is unchanged here, and still holds up, which will no doubt please long-time fans and newcomers alike. Smart new additions that feel like natural additions to the base game, coupled with a visual overhaul that captures the feel of the originals make for an experience that’s as nostalgic and comforting, as it is fresh and reinvigorating for the franchise.                             
85	                                Taken on its own, without the history of the franchise and the desire to see it be more, Pokémon Brilliant Diamond is a great RPG. There's a wide variety of content, the gameplay is fun and polished, and the presentation of the remake is charming and warm. While it's easier to recommend to newer Pokémon fans than those who played the Nintendo DS originals, taking another trip around a much more visually striking Sinnoh region turned out to be more satisfying than I anticipated. I'm certainly not in a hurry to leave it any time soon; that's for sure. However, with Pokémon Legends on the horizon, this one-two punch of Pokémon titles could be a winning way to close out one year and welcome in another, with a blast from the past followed by something we haven't really seen before. That's a Jigglepuff double-slap I can get behind.                            
85	                                Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl are the best way to enjoy the fourth generation. Coming back to Sinnoh after so many years feels amazing because of the new art style and the charismatic characters that inhabit the region. Also, the new features are very welcome for a better experience. These remakes are a must for any Pokémon fan who wants to feel nostalgic while also being great for new players.                            
85	                                While Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl don’t move the needle in terms of what Pokémon games will look and play like moving forward, they mostly hit the mark in being faithful to the originals. I’ve really enjoyed my time re-exploring Sinnoh, despite my qualms with the lack of critical path difficulty. They’re a welcome throwback to a simpler time when I felt completing a Pokédex was a somewhat realistic task to undertake. Veteran trainers will find plenty here to scratch a nostalgic itch, and new trainers who missed out the first time around have a solid adventure to embark on.                            
84	                                Players of the DS original might mostly experience the same game. But including some new cool features, its well modernized graphics and raised accessibility, this Pokémon RPG will be a joy to play as well for fans as for gamers of every age, who can get out just a little of the franchise.                            
80	                                In spite of a lot of missteps and unforced, unnecessary errors, however, Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl are great outings.                            
80	                                Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl are incredibly faithful remakes of Diamond and Pearl, warts and all. There are some nice new additions that enhance the experience, and the visual style is unique and quite good-looking. It’s hard not to recommend these to any Pokémon fan or newcomer to the franchise. There might be a few negatives, but none of them take much away from the overall excellent experience.                            
80	                                If a good remake is defined by its loyalty to the original, then Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl are very good remakes indeed. They are Diamond and Pearl down to nearly every detail, looking nicer than ever before with a few small tweaks, most of which are pretty good ones. It leaves in some of the original’s roster flaws, but they’re largely forgivable if you’re like me and have some degree of nostalgia for a time when Pokémon’s scope was smaller. And yet, I can’t help but be disappointed that Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl weren’t braver in how they improved upon the originals in the same way other Pokémon remakes were, bringing even some now-historic improvements back to correct history’s mistakes. Of course, I still had a perfectly pleasant time revisiting both Sinnoh and the simultaneously simpler yet more challenging era of Pokémon that took place within it reminded me of a time when this series asked a bit more of us.                            
80	                                Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl take me back to a simpler time in Pokémon where Mega Evolutions, Z-Moves, and Dynamaxing didn’t exist. It’s a wonderful reminder of how far Pokémon has come and it feels like a love letter to arguably the most formative generation of Pokémon.                            
80	                                Pokemon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl are good remakes of an inherently flawed Pokemon game. The games lean a little hard into recapturing the experience of the originals, which is a detriment and somewhat negates the fantastic visual and quality-of-life improvements. Honestly, it feels that Pokemon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl are a preemptive olive branch to Pokemon fans ahead of Pokemon Legends: Arceus, in that it provides a decidedly retro experience as an alternative option to what is sure to be the most envelope-pushing Pokemon game made since the franchise launched 25 years ago. Pokemon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl are made for those looking to celebrate the past of the Pokemon experience. For the rest of us, it's a nice distraction to hold us over until the launch of the next Pokemon game in a couple of months.                             
80	                                These gripes aside – and I realise that I’ve griped a lot in this review – Pokémon Pearl remains an excellent game, and the remake is of a very high quality. I’ve been able to reunite with Piplup, relive a very fondly-remembered adventure, and while there have been some tweaks that I’ve been less than amused by, on balance the developers have retained the qualities that made that game such a fondly remembered one.                            
80	                                The original DS Diamond and Pearl were great back in the day, and 15 years later this new coat of paint makes them just as entertaining. The improvements may not be as drastic as some may have hoped, but what's here is a solid Pokémon adventure regardless.                            
80	                                Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl are bordering on a masterclass of how to do faithful remakes of a classic and beloved series. They're nostalgic, charming, lovely experiences that perfectly mix the old with the new to present a journey that will appeal to fans of the originals while still keeping things fresh and up-to-date. As one half of a pair of Sinnoh games, they deliver on their half in spades, and show that The Pokémon Company is ready, willing, and able to mess with the formula for the sake of the series. I have my complaints here and there, too, but overall, these are the Diamond and Pearl remakes that I didn't know I wanted until I fell in love with them.                            
78	                                Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl are not the best games of the series nor the bravest, but they strongly respect the original games and the ones who played them, and they do everything they can to show that.                            
78	                                If you're a Pokemon fan and haven't played the original Diamond, Pearl, or Platinum then you're missing out. The Sinnoh region is an absolute joy to explore and it's super-fun trying to catch as many Pokémon as you can. Plus, Pokemon Shining Pearl lets you use the Nintendo Switch's network features in a way that you might not have had the opportunity to with the original DS games.                            
78	                                Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl offer exactly what you expect, sometimes a bit disappointing, but still oh so nice.                             
77	                                Two fairly correct remakes that will especially appeal to those who did not know the originals. On the contrary, veterans may be missing more news and, in particular, the changes introduced by Pokémon Platinum.                             
76	                                Unique remakes of their kind, which find all their strengths and weaknesses in the morbid attachment to the past.                             
75	                                Quotation forthcoming.                            
75	                                For fans, these throwbacks aren’t to be missed, but if you’re looking for a reason to see what Pokefuss is all about, you’ll find better avenues into the franchise than these remakes.                            
75	                                Despite everything, it's impossible to shy away from your pleasure when it comes to beating the League (not that easy, by the way) and watching your Pokémon evolve. A return to Sinnoh that could be improved, but very pleasant.                             
75	                                Whether you like the new "chibi" art direction of the Pokémon Diamond and Pearl remakes or not, you have to admit that a lot of fans will be happy to see the Gen 4 back on Nintendo Switch. Despite a lack of real new features and some flaws in the graphics, it's a real treat to be able to play again this iconic game with good tech on the Switch. Especially since (re)discovering Sinnoh is a great way to remember the area and better enjoy the return to the past with Legends Arceus.                            
74	                                Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl prove two things: that the original was a game loaded with charisma and that makes you come to the end of the remake looking forward to it, and that without the improvements and additions that the developers keep adding, however small and unambitious we may think they are, the house of cards falls down on us.                            
73	                                Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Pokémon Shining Pearl are a worthy return to Sinnoh, respectful remakes that seek to offer exactly the same experience as the original Nintendo DS works; albeit with new conveniences that help the pace of the adventure while borrowing quality-of-life details already established in the series. On the other hand, they are also much more permissive releases, with facilities during the adventure that cannot be turned off and that help too much in once-challenging situations. They are very conformist titles. The return of the random encounters did not convince us, especially after seeing how well the ability to see creatures in the environment worked. With plenty of content thanks to the Grand Underground and a generous endgame, it will provide plenty of hours of gameplay even though they are limited to the first four Pokémon generations. All of this, coupled with a beautiful art style despite being low-key on a graphical level, makes for an unmissable trip to Sinnoh for fans; especially those planning to play Pokémon Legends Arceus in a couple of months.                             
72	                                On the flip side, I'm not sure who this release is for. If you've never played Diamond and Pearl, you'll probably love these games. Assuming you don't mind a couple of tiny steps backwards in terms of mechanics. If you're familiar with the old games, this will be a mostly pleasant nostalgia trip. Especially if you've forgotten everything that happens, like me. The only hitch is the baffling visual and audio design. More than anything, these choices suggest that the Pokemon Company isn't exactly sure what fans want out of these games. Brilliant Pearl feels well-crafted yet confused, like they pursued several disparate visions at once. If you can see past these strange decisions, you'll find a set of pretty respectable Pokemon games.                            
70	                                Pokemon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl have their flaws and are not particularly ambitious remakes, but they’re somehow still fun. I don’t regret the 25 hours I spent with the main story of Brilliant Diamond, and there is enough post-game content to keep me interested for a while longer. I just can’t help but wish that these gems shined just a little bit more brilliantly.                            
70	                                Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl are remakes that stick closely to the original works, which turns out to be their worst mistake.                             
70	                                A nice tribute for the older fans and an accessible entrance for the youngest. Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl are still a good experience thanks to their strong DNA, but suffer from not taking any risks and from a globally questionable production.                            
70	                                Pokemon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl keep enough classic elements to feel like a comfy nostalgia trip, while smoothing over enough of the rough edges that they feel relatively contemporary with other recent Pokemon games. It can't be easy for a storied franchise to pay homage to its legacy while also modernizing in this way, but Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl strike the right balance. It's the classic Pokemon you remember, without most of the little annoyances you've forgotten.                            
70	                                Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl is a fun adventure, and the Grand Underground is bound to keep you busy. However, it fails to reach the heights of Pokémon Platinum, with a limited Pokédex that excludes several great Pokémon unnecessarily.                            
70	                                Pokemon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl show that not all remakes are worth playing if you have the originals on hand.                            
70	                                Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl play it safe, faithfully remaking two classic DS games -- at times to a fault.                            
70	                                Quotation forthcoming.                            
70	                                There are some much-needed quality of life improvements, and the games are well polished and run really smoothly on the Switch. It’s hard to see newer fans finding much to appreciate here, but those that have fond memories of the original Diamond and Pearl will have a lot to love about Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl.                            
70	                                Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl lead us to rediscover the fascinating Sinnoh region fourteen years after the original. Too bad that many of the improvements introduced by the Platinum version have been removed and that these remakes do not present any substantial upgrade, except for a renewed visual aspect.                            
70	                                The problem is that these are very good remakes of Diamond & Pearl and excellent games in and of themselves - they’re just nowhere near the best Gen 4 remake. Given that Platinum is still superior to Brilliant Diamond & Shining Pearl in almost every conceivable way, it’s difficult to comprehend why these games even exist aside from making them available on a modern console, in which case… just port Platinum. That’s the main takeaway I have from my time with Shining Pearl: it’s brilliant and it shines, but not quite as brilliantly bright as a game that came out 13 years ago.                            
68	                                Long-time Pokemon fans that don't mind the repetitive nature of these games will have a lot to look forward to here. Pokemon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl is by no means a bad Pokemon game. It's competently developed, but some of the decisions made prevent this entry in the franchise from standing out. The lack of changes from the original titles further bogs down this otherwise solid addition.                            
65	                                If you haven’t experienced Pokemon Diamond or Pearl yet and don’t have access to Platinum, then the Gen 4 remakes on Switch might be worth exploring. Sinnoh has its own charm to it, and completionists will likely enjoy the endgame that is Grand Underground collecting. I just hope that when the time comes to remake Black and White, whatever team handles it is a lot less conservative.                            
65	                                Everything genuinely good about this game exists mostly because the original Diamond and Pearl games had a good story and interesting characters. This game takes all those and rehashes it only through the veil of basic 3D characters that have the mobility of Funko Pops. Boring textures and an almost purposeful lack of detail takes something that was originally served as a masterful dish and converts it into a repackaged microwaved TV dinner.                            
65	                                What we have here is a very similar, yet different, version of Pokémon Diamond and Pearl in high definition on Switch, but it’s not definitively the best version to play today, as was the case with FireRed/LeafGreen, HeartGold/SoulSilver and Alpha Sapphire/Omega Ruby when they launched. While it’s not a stunningly brilliant or shining remake, it is a very faithful one that plays it safe and is a welcome return to Sinnoh for those with fond memories of visiting on the DS — but I’m more excited to see what’s new in the region with Pokémon Legends Arceus.                            
60	                                Despite the fresh coat of paint they feel stuck in the past, rolled off the factory line with seemingly little question as to why they’re doing it...Pokémon fans and newbies alike will love Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl because Diamond and Pearl were great. But there’s not enough brilliance or shine here to add the lustre they deserved.                            
60	                                A cheap-looking and unambitious remake of a generic Pokémon entry that seemed bereft of new ideas in 2006, let alone now.                            
60	                                While some of the slower elements of the original games have been fixed, and The Grand Underground makes up for the comparatively weak Pokédex, Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl’s new art style and a few other stumbles make this pair of games a somewhat disappointing retread of Generation 4. They’re also very clearly in the shadow of Pokemon Legends: Arceus, the upcoming open-world-like Pokemon game that has fans hoping it can take the series in exciting new directions beyond 20-year-old mechanics. If the remit of these remakes was to remain faithful to the original Gen 4 pair, we wish they’d also stuck to the pixel-art aesthetic. Aside from The Grand Underground – and the connectivity with the current games in the series – there’s very little reason to play Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl over your original DS copies.                            
90	                                Overall, Riders Republic takes what makes Forza Horizon great and puts an X-Games type twist to it. Biking, Snowboarding, and wingsuit races will make you want more action as you complete story missions and events to earn sponsors. Riders republic is out for most major systems and consoles right now for 59.99 USD.                            
90	                                Riders Republic is one of the biggest surprises of the year for me. A title with a gameplay so polished that it is capable of erasing all the bad preconceptions you could have about it. In the end, the most important thing about Riders Republic is that it makes you feel like the king of the mountain in every jump, every skid and every stunt that you manage to land safely on the ground.                             
90	                                A sprawling, varied, endlessly fun open-world game, and a glimmer of hope for the extreme sports genre.                            
88	                                What a ride! Riders Republic gives you an amount of freedom that you can hardly find anywhere else, and lets you choose your own path within a happy community that’s keen to celebrate your successes.                            
85	                                Going into Riders Republic, I thought it was going to be the gunning down steep slopes at high velocity that would make me feel ill. It turns out that the only aspect of Riders Republic that knocks me sick is the out-of-touch presentation of the NPCs. I’m being facetious here, because Riders Republic is one of the more genuine surprises of the year. I didn’t expect to find myself trying to perfect downhill runs until 3am. And yet, Riders Republic has completely dug its hooks into me. It imitates the unbridled feeling of freedom from the Forza Horizon games and perfects it in its own subgenre. If you’re looking for an octane-fuelled romp of a game with guaranteed fun, look no further than Riders Republic. Just be sure to bring your own jukebox.                            
82	                                Riders Republic is a high-octane ode to joy. An almost perfect extreme sports theme-park open world where having fun is the only thing that matters. Despite a confusing progression and some little hiccups camera and control-wise, Ubisoft Annecy brought in the best part of Steep, The Crew 2 and a bit of punk attitude to create a versatile and compelling experience, even if sometimes a bit too much overwhelming.                            
80	                                If you can get past the initial hour, Riders Republic becomes a very strong title. The world is a joy to explore thanks to the many biomes and landscape types you see. Compared to the rest of Ubisoft's open-world games, each pip on the map serves a much higher purpose than providing something to keep you busy. The instantaneous fast-travel, and the races pull off many adrenaline-pumping moments that you'll want to revisit. The title still has some issues, like some odd collision during the exploration and the unnecessary presence of microtransactions. Fans of racing will love what the various Ubisoft studios have pulled off with Riders Republic.                            
80	                                Riders Republic is a surprisingly good time with arcade-like extreme sports that feel thoroughly unique from one another. Online events are the best parts of the game, though it can get bogged down by glitches and server-related issues. Despite that, Riders Republic is still one of my surprise pleasures of 2021.                            
80	                                It's certain to make you smile and burst out with laughter with how silly it can get at times, make you feel a sense of achievement and satisfaction when completing objectives, and also make you want to throw your controller out the window when you just can't seem to win a race no matter how hard you try. Just don't expect too much from the Mass races.                            
80	                                Riders Republic is a thrilling, approachable, and incredibly varied extreme sports game, featuring an awe-inspiring open world that impresses with both its scale and diversity. There's nothing else quite like it, and while it's too talkative for its own good, there's a sprightly energy to the whole thing that makes it easy to recommend for anyone seeking an exciting adventure.                            
80	                                You'll find many enjoyable hours exploring, racing, and styling your way around Riders Republic. The world is gorgeous, the sound design and music choices are on point. There are only a few events that will frustrate you. Thankfully, you can mostly avoid these.                            
80	                                Riders Republic is genuinely fun and crazy enough to make you fall in love with it. Not everything falls into place, but Ubisoft managed to craft a captivating and crazy experience built on pure adrenaline.                            
80	                                Riders Republic is the best extreme sports game in ages, but it is, unfortunately, drowning in cringe. Luckily, the game’s beauty is in its gorgeous world and mechanics and not its characters or dialogue. You have to check this one out if you like extreme sports games and fancy a more precarious spin on Forza Horizon. Just be aware that the first impression is rough, and you may need to mattock through some shocking set dressing and turn off the dialogue to break into Riders Republic’s deeply satisfying core.                            
79	                                Sports spectacle in a massive world: Despite numerous minor flaws,Riders Republic is a playground complete with excitement.                            
77	                                Riders Republic misses its chance to be a great game due to some of its lacks in customization and gameplay. An extremely fun game that anyone who loves extreme sports should try.                            
75	                                If Riders Republic may disappoint Steep fans (the title goes against the spirit of the game of 2016), this new production remains a must for all thrill seekers. With its many playable sports disciplines, starting with the bike which offers exhilarating sensations, its exotic world and its many modes available both solo and online, the latest production from Ubisoft Annecy will undoubtedly keep you busy for the long haul.                             
72	                                There is more than enough variety to keep players coming back and having fun for months, just with the solo and collectible game alone. If you’re an extreme sports fan, Riders Republic is a no-brainer. For MMO fans looking for more than a madcap mass race challenge, I would let the game mature for a few months longer before picking this one up.                            
71	                                Extreme sports made accessible to the point of basic. It's got a tin ear but a big heart.                            
70	                                If you're into open worlds and extreme sports, Riders Republic is great. At least for about twenty hours. The world is gigantic and because of the intuitive controls the different sports are all fun to play. But Riders Republic falls into the same trap as its predecessor Steep, when it promises endless fun, but after a while there is no content anymore, if you are not willing to grind and play the same events over and over again. Besides there are technical issues with the Mass Races. It is always a gamble, if the race works or you get kicked out of the session.                             
60	                                Riders Republic tries to improve the Steep formula on many levels, but sometimes fails to really find its own way: by constantly soliciting the players with its trials, rewards, gears, modes and extras, Ubisoft Annecy's new formula sometimes forgets to let us enjoy the ride and its vast landscape.                             
87	                                Crysis Remastered Trilogy is a must-have for any fan of the games or of the FPS genre in general. This release represents the best way to play three of the best shooters from the mid-2000s. The absence of Warhead and multiplayer is unfortunate, though. Still, for the price, the amount of quality content that you get here is well worth it.                            
85	                                Between all three games, the Crysis Remastered Trilogy effectively provides something of a microcosm of how the first person shooter genre has evolved over the years, with the completely freeform open world beats of the first game soon being replaced by the linear opulence of the final game in the trio. That said, if you're a fan of the genre in general or have been hankering to play Crytek's impressive trio of shooter offerings for sometime now, there really is no better place to jump in than with the Crysis Remastered Trilogy.                            
80	                                Crysis Trilogy Remastered is a fantastic value proposition with three full campaigns to play through. Perhaps a little dated mechanically, all three games are solid shooters with loads to do. A good example of how to do remasters, despite only the first supporting RTX.                            
80	                                Sporting two of the best FPS experiences of the early 2010s and the original, mindblowing graphical powerhouse that busted many a rig in 2007, the Crysis Remastered Trilogy offers hours of solid, smooth and satisfying FPS action. Not all of the improvements hit the mark, but the core of these titles is left intact. If you’ve never played Crysis before, now’s your chance to save the world in style with your ass-kicking Nanosuit. Just watch out for the first impression.                             
80	                                The Crysis Remastered Trilogy is not just for purists but is a series that can now be played perfectly on the PlayStation 5 for anyone. Unlike some of the more recent “remastered” games, The Crysis Remastered Trilogy is a true remastered experience that delivers an almost next-gen experience with some stunning graphical improvements. Sure, the gameplay is a little dated at times but when matched with the over the top game mechanics, it delivers an enjoyable experience as you take on aliens and private military organisations from Asia to the United States in true first person shooter blockbuster action!                            
80	                                Crysis Trilogy Remastered brings a previously ambitious line of games into the spotlight of consoles. The "Can it run Crysis?" meme will live on in our hearts forever, but these remasters show that many things can now run the infamous shooter.                            
80	                                A juicy but still perfectible bundle full of single-player-only-FPS-nanosuit-action. Thankfully Crytek and Saber Interactive's work on the second and third chapter is better than the one made on the previous one.                            
80	                                Overall, Crysis Remastered Trilogy is a great set of remasters and those who skipped these games initially should strap on their nanosuits and give the franchise a shot.                            
80	                                The whole Crysis saga can now be played with enhanced visuals, especially on next-gen consoles: while the gameplay is somewhat frozen in time and show the limits of games developed in another era, there’s much to enjoy and the games are still fun to play.                            
80	                                The series may no longer be the graphical tour de force it once was, but all three Crysis games remain highly playable, your nanosuit’s suite of powers adding a distinct twist to the shooter action.                            
80	                                Outside of these technical issues, Crysis Remastered Trilogy does an excellent job of porting a classic video game series to modern day consoles. It maintains the core gameplay centered around making players an actual super soldier while upgrading visuals and performance for a satisfying experience. Those looking to try Crytek's magnum opus series for the first time or experience the adventures once again should find a lot to enjoy about Crysis Remastered Trilogy.                            
75	                                After so many years, Crytek have finally managed to present the Crysis series on consoles in an appropriate way and as close as possible to the PC experience, but be warned that the dated AI and level design take some of its former glory away.                            
75	                                On PS5 and Xbox Series, the three games are very convincing: the real regret comes mainly from the fact that the trilogy is not offered, strictly speaking, on new generation machines, using only backward compatibility to boost its rendering. We must then draw a line on immediate loading, ray tracing or even support for DualSense features, despite a good rendering. As for the Crysis themselves, it is clear that a number of mechanisms are now aging: they remain good titles, but never speak of excellence ... It's up to you to see what you are looking for. [Tested on PS5]                            
75	                                The Crysis Remastered Trilogy is a great blast from the past. Fans of the series will have a great time replaying these classics, or maybe introducing younger gamers to one of the late aught’s can’t-miss franchises. It’s a shame Saber Interactive didn’t have more fun with additional modern features, but this still represents great value. At a launch price of $49.99 USD for all three games, this is a no-brainer for Crysis fans, as well as gamers looking for a lot of first-person shooting action without breaking the bank.                            
75	                                The Crysis Remastered Trilogy allows you to relive a product that at the time had pioneering traits for the industry and that perhaps for this very reason still had ample room for improvement. While at times returning an impression of a brake on, the story remains enjoyable and the approach chosen allows you to relive an experience updated to the parameters of current consoles.                            
70	                                Tweaks across the series improve on how each ability can be used, and Crysis 3 is a visual *chef’s kiss*. They all, however, fall apart in the final third and that none of these remasters offer online multiplayer is a crime – and oddly, for a game built on freedom, restrictive. [Issue#8, p.90]                            
70	                                Crysis Remastered Trilogy is a remarkable remastered experience, specially on consoles, although the passing of the years is felt in gameplay and controls, particularly in the first one. A bet for fans of the genre who already played them in the past or for those who want to discover an iconic saga.                            
70	                                The end result is an average overall package by today's standards, but three games plucked from a decade or more ago should be proud to land safely average in the middle of today's pack and standards.                            
70	                                Overall, the Crysis Remastered Trilogy is a weird product. While it’s great there’s a (mostly) high-quality version of the original Crysis available to console players, it’s also the only real highlight. Crysis 2 remains a dreary scaling-back of its predecessor, and while I like Crysis 3 more than the second, it’s not particularly noteworthy. The most compelling argument to be made here is to players who’ve been curious about Crysis after hearing about it for years — now, here’s a great way to play it. Getting the other two is just a bonus.                            
70	                                Crysis takes a minimalist approach to the space/sci-fi shooter genre, dropping you in fierce combat with few tools at your disposal. The first game remains a challenge to get through for the wrong reasons, but Crysis 2 is still fun to play, despite not capitalizing on the series’ strengths. Crysis 3 is the highlight, but if anything, it just underscores how much better Crysis 4 could be. Re-releasing the trilogy on modern consoles makes it more accessible, sure, but I’d rather see how the series can continue evolving instead of re-experiencing its struggles to define a clear identity.                            
70	                                Even with the missing multiplayer, Crysis' sci-fi single player campaigns provide a decent experience.                            
70	                                Yes, these versions are clearly superior to the ones we saw on consoles and you can justify your purchase again if you love the series or if you have been curious about Crytek games, but the improvements are rather small and in essence it is the PC version with other lighting.                            
70	                                You can cleary notice that these games come from another era, but they are still enjoyable for players looking for some cool action and adrenaline.                            
70	                                As it was 14 years ago, Crysis remains a technical marvel – although at times PlayStation 4 can't handle the titanic task of 'running Crysis'.                            
60	                                Three ten-hour games in one package might seem good value, but the truth is the Crysis series only hits its stride in fits and spurts until the third game. On PS4 the remastered graphics get better as the series goes on, so there’s no real reason to play the first game unless you’re already a fan or you’re interested to see how Crysis started. Crytek’s series is certainly interesting to dissect as you go through. Consistently fun to play, though? That’s a different story.                            
40	                                My biggest issue with the Crysis Remaster Trilogy is that it only feels halfway remastered. Nothing was updated to modern standards except for the visuals, and that is a huge problem. Remasters like the Spyro and Tony Hawk ones work so well because the gameplay is smoothed out and plays like a modern game. Unfortunately, that oversight (or failure, if they really did try to update it from the originals) makes it impossible to recommend the beautiful-looking collection to anyone other than hardcore fans of the original games. I really wanted to enjoy these games that were so positively talked about when I was younger, but sadly they didn’t come anywhere close to living up to the hype with this remaster attempt.                            
85	                                CyberConnect2 fulfills all our expectations with Demon Slayer Hinokami Chronicles. The title is great for fans of the manga and newcomers alike, however, there is definitely room for improvement.                            
80	                                Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba – The Hinokami Chronicles faithfully recreates popular anime Demon Slayer as a competitive 3D action fighting game. While the amount of playable characters and the exploration part leave room for improvement, there’s a lot to love here for fans of the source material.                            
76	                                It's a shame the gameplay is so similar to past games and the exploration segments so bland, because the recreation of the anime it's truly spectacular; the best to date in a CyberConnect2 game. Fans of Kimetsu no Yaiba will probably enjoy it, even with the severe lack of content.                            
75	                                Kimetsu No Yaiba: Hinokami Chornicles stands out for its history and beauty in battles, even though with very basic mechanics and boring modes.                            
72	                                The Hinokami Chronicles is a fighter arena with a poor character roster at the time of its release, and an inorganic story mode. You will be forced to finish it only to see the cutscenes and unlock the characters, instead of exploring battle systems. But not everything is disappointing, as the art direction is incredible, with special attacks taken directly from the anime, and the inclusion of the original music is greatly appreciated.                            
70	                                Demon Slayer -Kimetsu No Yaiba- The Hinokami Chronicles is one for the fans, yet still accessible for beginners. Aside from a few functionality problems in gameplay, it is a great load of fun being able to fight against familiar faces and take the leading role in the story of Demon Slayer. The developers of the game may have missed a prime opportunity to expand on the exploration experience, but at the end of the day, this is a game focused on the thrill of battling against Demons and looking cool while doing so.                            
70	                                When I look at Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba – The Hinokami Chronicles I keep seeing the usual formula that Cyberconnect2 has been using for years of anime tie-in fighters. It’s still an enjoyable and fun fighting game, if you care enough to get into its more obscure mechanics, but it could have been much better with more emphasis on a proper training mode and a more fleshed out campaign. Nonetheless, it’s also one of the prettiest game ever developed by the software house that created .Hack and a proper celebration of the bombastic action sequences of the original animated series produced by world-known animation studio Ufotable.                            
70	                                This is a very faithful adaptation of the anime and that’s something fans will love, even if unfortunately it’s very limited gameplay-wise.                            
70	                                For fans of anime fighting games, Demon Slayer -Kimetsu no Yaiba- The Hinokami Chronicles is a compelling experience. Even if you're a newcomer to the series, this is a game that is fun to play, with a bold narrative that grips you early on. It may feel light at times, but it's a fine example of what CyberConnect2 does best.                             
65	                                Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba - The Hinokami Chronicles is very faithful to the anime, with an excellent use of cel shading for the characters and a couple of notable locations, although severely limited in structure and interactions. However the story campaign is very short and you're going to beat it in a few hours.                            
65	                                Demon Slayer: The Hinokami Chronicles isn't really a step forward after Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4. The new CyberConnect2 game lacks content, and the story mode play and feels old. Even so, the combat system shines thanks to some minor tweaks and adjustments, and the PvP is as fun as it should be. Sadly, you have to endure a pretty bad six hours campaign before you are finally allowed to participate in some downright spectacular battles with the full roster of characters.                            
60	                                Quotation forthcoming.                            
55	                                As a fan of Demon Slayer series you’ll probably have an easier time communicating with the game, but for anybody else there isn’t much entertainment on offer here as long cut scenes and shallow gameplay really hurt the overall experience.                            
80	                                More than a nostalgic joke, Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl delivers a genuinely fantastic cartoon fighting game just slightly marred by unpolished presentation.                            
70	                                A lot of the game feels like a rough draft, but it's simplistic enough for families to jump into for a quick match and have a lot of fun. Just don't expect to spend a ton of time with it. [Issue #56 – November/December 2021, p. 70]                            
70	                                The long and short of it is that if you’re a fan of Nickelodeon and Smash, this is absolutely worth it, but it might take some time to flesh out the sturdy fighting skeleton with some Mr Meaty.                             
70	                                Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl is the best Super Smash Bros game I’ve played not featuring Mario. The fighting system underpinning it is a lot of fun, introducing enough new elements to stand on its own amongst its peers and having enough depth to foster competitive play going forward. It’s a shame that the list of features and content is so threadbare and that some further love hasn’t been shown for the rich source material, but hopefully, the developers can support the game and expand on this in either updates or a sequel. For the time being, this is a solid alternative to Smash Bros if you’re after something a little different, or just want to reset the playing field for that one friend who has just become too good at Ultimate.                            
70	                                Ultimately, Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl is a solid competitive platform fighter, but it's lacking in several key elements. If you've got a group of buddies that enjoy competitive Smash and have a lot of love for Nickelodeon's catalog of cartoon characters, you'll find All-Star Brawl quite satisfying. But if you're looking for substantial single-player experiences or a fun mess-around party fighter you can play casually with friends and family, you're going to run back to the warm embrace of Nintendo's juggernaut very quickly.                            
70	                                A person could buy Super Smash Bros. Ultimate for just a little more money, and unless they’re a Nick fan, they probably should. But if you already have Smash and are looking for something else along those lines, this is a good pick-up.                            
70	                                Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl is obviously in no position to take the platform fighter throne right now, but I think the teams at Ludosity and Fair Play Labs have created a very good blueprint for what could be a very great franchise. If Super Smash Bros. is a celebration of all things Nintendo, I don’t see why an All-Star Brawl 2 couldn’t be a celebration of all things Nickelodeon. I think it’s possible with the right amount of time and money, and I hope this game is successful enough to convince GameMill to invest in a sequel that could be truly spectacular.                            
70	                                Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl is riddled with flaws. Not very pretty, not always very precise, a little sparse in content, the dubbing of the original cartoons are absent ... However, the fighting game of Fair Play Labs exudes passion. We don't recommend it to everyone, as NASB is targeting a very specific niche. By mimicking the physics of Super Smash Bros. Melee and implementing one of its advanced techniques, this atypical brawler manages to seduce those nostalgic for the early 2000s. Those will see it as a good way to immerse themselves in the licenses of their childhood while by rediscovering familiar sensations and a solid competitive environment. Hopefully the studio's follow-up will be good, as Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl is holding something.                             
70	                                Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl is a solid platform fighter with an awful lot of hidden depth, and also an unfortunate lack of polish outside the fighting. If hardcore gameplay is the number one concern you’ll have a wealth to sink your teeth into here, but expect to be underwhelmed by various elements that surround it. There's a grand old time to be had, but it's no Super Smash Bros. (damn it yet again).                            
65	                                Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl often feels hollow and commercial; however, at its core, it remains fun and engaging enough to warrant its $40 price tag.                            
65	                                The new Nickelodeon's fighting game feels great in terms of gameplay, but it fails in everything else. The characters' voices are lacking, the presentation is generic, the songs are not the licensed ones and a DLC was already announced even before the game came out.                            
60	                                Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl is an ambitious game that tries to pit 20 classic Nick characters against each other in a platform brawler highly reminiscent of Super Smash Bros. However, due to technical issues and a lack of immersive details like voice acting, it doesn't stand up to the competition. This game will excite people who love Nickelodeon and platform brawlers but will be a hard sell to anyone else.                            
60	                                Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl is a passable Smash Bros. clone. While it lacks the depth and polish of a game like Smash Bros, it’s not without its charm. Being able to brawl it out with beloved Nickelodeon characters such as Ren & Stimpy, TMNT’s Michelangelo, and Patrick from Spongebob Squarepants is a lot of fun at first. Unfortunately, the lack of depth really starts to take notice when you realize the 20 playable characters is all that’s included – no unlockable characters or stages. Completing the Arcade mode provides no unique character endings; however, you do get some unlockable images and music to view in the Extras menu. Beyond that, your only drive is to try and complete the game with each character on more challenging difficulties.                            
60	                                Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl is a must-play for the hardcore, but doesn't look after casual audiences.                            
55	                                Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl almost feels as if it was sold on the sheer premise of reviving Melee with Nickelodeon characters. On the fighting end, it mostly succeeds, but due to a lack of polish, cut corners and just a cheap feel, I’m skeptical how long this game can keep your attention. Yes, the sheer hilarity of seeing Patrick Star beat up CatDog is still funny, but I don’t think the lifespan of this game will increase over time. Watching all these fighters silently duke it out makes it feel like we’re watching storyboards for a singular crossover episode. While that may entice you into watching the commercials, the final product just leaves all these popular properties feel compromised.                            
90	                                Hot Wheels Unleashed appeared without warning, in a fast, abrasive way, much like the miniature cars that lend it its name. The game is one of this year’s surprise hits, e one of the best arcade racing experiences in recent memory. It easily earns its place has the best Hot Wheels game ever, with slick, balanced driving and a phenomenal variety of miniatures.                            
80	                                Hot Wheels Unleashed will take you on a nostalgic ride back to your childhood days. You will get a fun, unforgettable experience, the same one back when we were playing with real Hot Wheels toy cars!                            
80	                                Hot Wheels Unleashed is a fun arcade racer for the whole family, whose biggest weakness is the counting lootbox system, which dampens the passion for collecting to a degree.                            
75	                                Hot Wheels: Unleashed is a good game if you are a fan of the franchise and looking for a racing title that goes straight to the point without the need to master complicated techniques. The important thing here is to feel the speed and let your imagination fly.                            
70	                                Engaging tracks and an enjoyable selection of cars makes for a colorful and fun, but clumsy racing game.                            
60	                                Hot Wheels Unleashed doesn’t have much to offer, and as an arcade racing can only be entertaining for a few hours before fading to the bottom of your game library.                            
60	                                Hot Wheels Unleashed -- in all caps and bolded letters -- is a passable arcade racer that sticks out from other middle-of-the-road racing games thanks to its devotion to nostalgia and some great ideas that are unfortunately not completely realized due to obvious budgetary restrictions. If you're desperate to get behind the wheel of your favorite Hot Wheel, it will scratch that itch, but not much else.                            
90	                                Sable lacks the same level of polish as Breath of the Wild or other AAA open-world titles. But as an indie game made by a small team, Sable is an unforgettable adventure that can elicit a deeply personal connection to the player.                            
84	                                Sable is a beautiful game, with an astonishing soundtrack and artistic vision, that show us the journey of self-discovery of our young protagonist through an exotic planet, full of sand, mountains and spaceships.                             
84	                                Sable it's a wonderful adventure that, at first sight, can seem slow and with frustrating aspects (slow pace, world apparently empty...), but its universe will hook you up with lots of mysteries to unfold and the main character's journey. All that with an unique audiovisual and aesthetics that will leave you wanting more, even with evident faults.                            
80	                                Sable, with its sci-fi desert, reflective soundtrack and reverent respect for architecture, could so easily have valued aesthetic over impact. But the actual feel of the game experience itself is the oasis in the middle of a desert of incredible ideas and inspiring design choices. Sable concocts a warm world full of delight and character at its edges, and leaves the gaps in between intentionally blank for you to fill with your own stories – and it’s quite unlike anything else you’ll play this year.                            
80	                                There's a melancholia to Sable, wrapped up in the ruined cities and gigantic skeletons dotting its landscapes, but this is balanced with an infectious core of positivity running through the game. What it lacks in drama, it more than makes up for with sheer creativity and grandeur, leaving you with a sense of serenity much-needed and appreciated in these bizarre times. However, it all circles back to the joy of discovery: you might not know exactly what you’ll find as you peel back the layers of Midden, but it’s bound to be interesting.                            
80	                                A few rough edges do not stop Sable from being a one-of-a-kind adventure about finding yourself while alone in the big wide world. I hope Sable can fix its technical issues soon, because what’s underneath is a game full of discovery, tiny nuggets of wisdom and a plethora of ways to customise your insanely cool hover bike.                            
78	                                In Sable, all parts intertwine in a perfect manner. Alone the technical deficiencies currently impair the experience.                            
75	                                A thoroughly enjoyable and relaxing voyage of soul-searching self-discovery, Sable is also a rewarding jaunt across an otherworldly desert that involves climbing, hoverbiking, and gliding. And rather good it is, too.                             
73	                                Sable is one of the latest games to get a day one release on Xbox’s Game Pass service so it’s almost impossible to not give it a recommendation for anyone with a subscription, but on the whole, I was somewhat let down. The game has some of the most visually stunning graphics I’ve seen, but the gameplay gets repetitive. Exploring the desolate expanse on your own terms is not as fun as it sounds; however, a compelling series of quests and wonderful writing throughout are just enough to keep you hooked and justify the price of admission if you’re already a Game Pass subscriber.                            
70	                                Sable does so much well that it’s a shame that these issues consistently distract from its stunning world. This is the sort of game that may be easy to recommend in a few months after a few patches, but I can only rate the game as it is. There’s still a lot to like here if you’re willing to put up with some frustration along the way. Just know that if you purchase it now, you’ll be dealing with a less than smooth ride.                            
70	                                Perhaps it's the writing, or those aforementioned best moments, or more likely some potent combination of factors, but Sable is special. I can feel it, still, hours after putting the pad down; the sensation of riding a geyser to a mountain peak, the crack of the crystal pillar under my avatar's feet. That golden sunrise breathing warmth back into this world. At the risk of repeating myself, it absolutely deserves to be played - just maybe not right now, and not quite like this.                             
70	                                A visual tribute to Mœbius, Sable seduces first of all with its captivating features and colors. He is also granted an exploration rich in great freedom and some gripping mysteries. But the sawtooth technique is terribly lacking on the trip. And the universe lacks a certain consistency, struggling to engage us completely during its long stroll.                             
70	                                Sable’s unique art style, memorable characters and quests, and engaging open-ended formula are going to stick with me for a long time. But the numerous technical issues, wonky camera, and bland puzzles all make this otherwise compelling odyssey a lot rockier. Those issues can be frustratingly frequent distractions, but when they did manage to fade into the background I found myself mesmerized by Sable’s bizarre world of creepy worms, masked weirdos, and hoverbikes.                            
70	                                With its striking art direction, haunting soundtrack and focus on exploration, Sable is a great journey about understanding yourself. Frequent stuttering and some bugs bring the experience down though.                            
70	                                It offers an otherworldly break from the busyness of life, and, when you do return to Earth, you will do so with a smooth landing, and without stress.                            
60	                                It breaks my heart to criticise Sable so. The first few hours are truly remarkable, packed with moments of beauty, creativity, and childlike wonder, but the more you play, the more the mask slips. Despite the technical issues, it's testament to the abilities of the small team that it has been able to create a world so inventive and interesting, if one whose sparseness starts to work against it once the initial sightseeing tour is over. It's a crying shame, though, that those who want to see everything that this captivating setting has to offer — whether through inherent completionism, chasing achievements, or simply being drawn in by the lush playground itself — are those who will suffer Sable at its worst, even if the highs should still prove strong enough to carry you through the lows in the end.                            
60	                                Despite its gorgeous graphics and a superb soundtrack Sable still featureS too many collision bugs to deliver the oniric adventure it is supposed to. Only those who will excuse its many technical flow will enjoy a true chillful and arty open world, with many surprises and enigmatic nomads to meet all the way.                            
50	                                A stunning visual style can’t hide the fact that Sable is not only uninterested in guiding its players but it doesn’t really care about entertaining them either.                            
80	                                While The Good Life still has some annoyances carried over from Deadly Premonition, it’s still a great time with some wacky characters. The transformations and photography are a lot of fun to mess around with, and the life simulation aspects compliment the more relaxed pace nicely.                            
79	                                Weird, good natured, and pretty funny with it, The Good Life stands apart, like most SWERY games.                            
70	                                The Good Life is another flawed yet fascinating gem from Swery65. It's a weird world full of unforgettable characters, and even when the gameplay grows a bit tiring or repetitive, it's worth all the photo quests and fetch missions in the world to see that next bonkers twist in the story.                             
70	                                The Good Life comes with excellent narrative elements, but the entire experience is damaged by some weird design choices that result in mediocre gameplay. While this is hardly surprising for a game directed by SWERY, some of the ideas featured in The Good Life, like the cat and dog transformation mechanics, deserved a much better execution, as they feel shallow and not particularly interesting. With such flawed gameplay, only die-hard fans of the Japanese director will truly love The Good Life.                            
70	                                In spite of its lack of polish, I enjoyed The Good Life. It has some rough edges, but these can contribute to its charm, and it’s undeniably entertaining when the story is purposely silly or when I had time to just breathe in the world. The Good Life has heart, even if its features don’t always work together and its design holds it back.                             
60	                                The Good Life is a curious and uneven experience. As a sort of hybrid RPG meets life-sim, it's certainly competent, despite the grind it demands. Surprisingly, the novel premise takes a back seat for the most part, but it's never anything less than adorably easy-going, carried along by a carefree attitude and endless charm.                            
60	                                If you can get through the fetch quests and borderline walking simulator elements, then The Good Life has an intriguing narrative for you to unravel and enjoy. It’s charming and unique in its own way, with its goofy presentation and silly supernatural elements. Maybe it’s the good life that SWERY65 had always imagined.                            
60	                                The Good Life does many things, but they never felt like they coalesced together into an experience that could stick with me. I certainly enjoyed parts of it, and some of its stranger moments really do land as big, enjoyable peaks. But there’s a lot of valley in-between, and while I arrived in Rainy Woods eager for a pleasant countryside escape, I didn’t feel like making a return trip after the credits had rolled.                            
58	                                The Good Life is Swery's first take on the Life simulators genre. While it incorporates all the features that made him a cult creator it also shows a disorienting mix of elements and mechanics that just don't work well together. The thin narrative line and the histrionic cast of characters fail to fully flesh out the social commentary that the creator intended to convey. The whole experience ends up feeling more like a list of chores rather than a smart and enjoyable experience in Swery's characteristic Troma-like fashion.                            
50	                                The Good Life makes for a charmingly eccentric getaway for the 12 hours its story lasts, though you'd hardly want to spend weeks, let along months, there. [Issue#365, p.116]                            
50	                                While The Good Life is an often frustrating and dull experience, riddled with annoying mechanics and lacking in polish, I’d struggle to say that I necessarily had a bad time overall. I found the town of Rainy Woods and its mysteries engaging enough to want to see the experience through to the end. There are so many nuggets of potential that are held back by irritating health meters and repetitive side quests. If you’re a fan of SWERY’s previous output or have a lot of patience for fetch quests, there is reason enough to check out The Good Life, but it is a hard sell for pretty much anyone else.                            
50	                                I love bad games. But The Good Life doesn’t fall into this category of bad-fun, it’s simply too much of a mess. Did anyone say no to anything in the course of refining the core concept of this game? Probably not. Is it even fun? I still don’t know because even after 8 to 10 hours, I feel stuck between a begrudging sense of sunk-cost fallacy and possible Stockholm syndrome as someone who also once faced ruinous debt and an unwanted move. Honestly, there’s no such thing as a good life unless you have paws, eat garbage and can pee freely in public, but you don’t need to play this game to know that.                            
50	                                Squint hard enough and you may latch onto some modicum of intrigue with the mechanics it offers and the objectives it poses. But for anyone inexperienced with Swery’s past work — let alone those who simply don’t take well to ample busywork — The Good Life is unfortunately equal parts unappealing and unsure on just what kind of game it wants to be.                            
50	                                The Good Life is a bit of a mess, trying to be too many things and getting very little right, with weak characters and an unpolished plot.                            
50	                                Boring, pointless, and jammed with grating characters and obnoxious story beats, The Good Life doesn't live up to its name.                            
100	                                Deathloop is one of the best games of the year — at least from what I’ve played so far. And I say that as someone who has previously recognized the quality of Arkane games while struggling to enjoy them. But with this game, French team Arkane Lyon used some smart tricks to amplify its strengths. And the result is a special experience that has broader appeal than some other Arkane projects.                            
100	                                As Arkane’s been acquired by Xbox, this is its first and last PS5 exclusive. But what better parting gift than a perfect day you could happily live again and again? [Issue#6, p.72]                            
100	                                The things is, you don’t have to think about anything if you don’t want to; you can just enjoy the adrenaline rush, blasting symbolic victims of player violence (enemies even disappear in a whirl of multicoloured light when shot, a self-reflexive reference to the sheer disposability of non-player characters). But a darker subtext is always there, if you want to look beneath the gleaming surface...In this way, Deathloop gets to have its cake and eat it – over and over again. And it is, to be fair, absolutely delicious.                            
100	                                Deathloop takes elements from games like Bioshock and Dishonored, combining them with a Groundhogs Day like timeloop to create the coolest, most stylish, and best game of the year.                             
100	                                For all of its complexities under the hood, Deathloop is Arkane’s most accessible game yet and elicits constant satisfaction. The action is a pleasure, while its main drive has you constantly picking up pieces of an unknown puzzle that are pieced together in separate chunks, before the frisson of excitement when the full picture starts to form. What’s extraordinary is how Arkane make it seem so easy. Blockbuster game-making at its smartest and most essential.                            
100	                                Is Deathloop perfect? For that, the story is a bit too slow to start, at times you are led by the hand just a little too much, and there were still too many bugs in our review copy. But that can be solved with patches and updates, and the pace does not detract from this intelligent and well-crafted murder puzzle. Let's hope it's the first of its kind.                            
100	                                Deathloop layers a refined take on Arkane’s signature mix of ability-driven action and stealth onto a time-looping premise, and the result is one of most memorable games of recent years. While many of the pieces may be familiar, the combination is fresh and full of surprises.                            
100	                                Deathloop is a fascinating and brilliant game. It subverts expectations out of the gate, providing players with a deep mystery that is solved by compelling, diverse gameplay. While being similar to Arkane’s previous work, it is almost like anything else you may have played while still housing familiar, recognizable elements. A whirlwind of intrigue, action, and style crafts Deathloop into a melting pot of smart, bold choices. Thankfully, Deathloop transcends its shackles as an amalgamation of “Arkane’s Greatest Hits” by offering players a thrilling take on shooters. Combat puzzles involving webs of untruths and harrowing escapes turn Blackreef into a time loop you won’t want to break from. And a definitive candidate for one of the best shooters in years.                            
100	                                There’s a lot to enjoy here and the banter between Colt and Julianna is entertaining in and of itself… Colt starting out being very unsure of himself (not even knowing who he is to start with) to (re)gaining his confidence and going on the offensive. There’s a lot of swearing and a lot of blood shed so this clearly isn’t for the younger gamers or those who are sensitive to such things… but for the rest of us this is a lot of fun!                            
100	                                Taken as a single-player experience, Deathloop feels complete and incredibly well-rounded. The extra injection of optional multiplayer action is a fabulous cherry on top. Basically, Deathloop is everything I wanted it to be. It’s confident both as a successor to many of the ideas of Dishonored while also expressly its own thing, with a tone and sense of style I absolutely adore. It’s one of my favourite games of the year - and one we’ll surely be talking about for months to come.                            
100	                                Deathloop encases fun investigation work and satisfying combat in a unique time loop mechanic to create a tremendously satisfying adventure.                            
100	                                Deathloop feels like the end result of an experiment that Arkane started with the release of Prey: Mooncrash. In many ways, it has successfully nurtured that genius nugget of an idea — a roguelike immersive simulator — into a AAA blockbuster. I am once again blown away by Arkane’s ambitions in game design, and how they manage to maintain them alongside such strong aesthetics, and compelling writing. This is an essential purchase if you value video games that expand the medium’s boundaries.                            
100	                                Deathloop is both unique and familiar, subverting time, gameplay and expectations in equal measure. A mystery worth solving and experience worth having, there is nothing on this planet quite like Deathloop.                            
100	                                Deathloop is not only one of the most conceptually ambitious and well executed games ever made, but Arkane's PlayStation swansong also has a boundless energy and ingenuity that no other game can match. Quite simply, Deathloop is an unparalleled synergy of first-person shooter design, explorative bliss and narrative complexity that we likely won't see again for a very, very long time.                              
100	                                Deathloop feels like your first bite of a cheesecake after being stranded on a desert island and living off seaweed for six months. In a sea of shotgun-spread triple-A games that are all too familiar, Deathloop is a precision 50. cal bullet of originality right through your eye socket.                            
100	                                Deathloop is the kind of game that will get in your head and stay there even when you’re not playing. Colt is a great protagonist, the intricate environmental design is a dream to explore, and the loop system keeps things fresh and offers so much replayability. Simply put, Deathloop is fantastic.                            
100	                                Deathloop is slick and inventive, with a delicious sense of style and humour. It distils Arkane’s hefty systems into something more explicitly playful, then leaves its sparkling cast to run riot in its huge interlocking puzzle of an island. One of the smartest and most outright entertaining games of the year.                            
100	                                Deathloop is a game where observation and dynamic thinking go hand-in-hand with shotgunning goons in the face and snapping their necks ... it delivers bombastic thrills and wince-inducing kills with intelligence and elegance in equal measure.                            
95	                                Rich in detail and brilliantly designed, Deathloop brings new life into a familiar story trope. It's polished game mechanics help Deathloop remain intriguing and challenging at all times, which makes it a paramount addition to the new PS5 game library.                            
95	                                Deathloop is one of the finest, most unique experiences in the video game space in recent memory. Sure, it’s got that familiar Arkane feel, but the amalgamation of all of Deathloop’s various influences, genuinely comedic writing, great voice acting, intricate level design, and an engaging, mysterious story that unfolds as you play make Deathloop an absolute joy to play.                            
95	                                Deathloop is a game that will be talked about for a long time and one that will undoubtedly be in the running for Game of the Year 2021. Its well-crafted systems, gripping narrative threads and quasi-choose your own adventure style gameplay make it the best Next-Gen title so far.                            
95	                                Deathloop is probably one of the best examples of really blending those rogue-lite elements into an otherworldly and excellent story, freedom of choice, tight controls and a delightful cast of characters all wrapped in a beautiful package.                            
95	                                Deathloop is a magnificently unstructured FPS filled with loads of weapons and abilities that never stops being fun.                            
95	                                There isn't anything else quite like Deathloop. It's a riveting detective mystery, plays with time loops in unique ways, and never feels like it slows down, even in those stealthier moments. It's a game that's thought out top-to-bottom, with two perfect leads heralding the charge and a unique multiplayer component that feels central to everything that Deathloop is, without ever getting in the way. Whether you're looking to break the loop or preserve it, Blackreef is certainly worth the visit. You may find yourself as stuck there too.                            
92	                                Deathloop is one of the most complex and elegant ways of video game design. Arkane Studios reinvented their own formula in an impressive new immersive sim title.                             
90	                                I’m honestly surprised, because I did not expect to have so much fun with Deathloop. It draws some gameplay ideas from Dishonored, but introduces time-related mechanics, offers an intriguing story with interesting characters and has its own unique and coherent style. It’s an original game, full of surprises and addictive, but not necessarily easily digestible for everyone. For me however it’s one of the best titles of 2021. [11/2021, p.22]                            
90	                                Deathloop is Arkane at its best, combining its system-driven immersive-sim gameplay with a unique and fascinating story set-up. Excellent presentation and style, along with fantastic dialogue and character performances makes Deathloop one of the most innovative games in years and a valuable PS5 exclusive.                            
90	                                At the beginning of the game, and every morning since, Colt wakes up with a single objective: break the loop. But we're increasingly starting to sympathize with Juliana. Why would you want to do that, when there's still so much to play around with? [Issue#364, p.98]                            
90	                                Deathloop is another proof that Arkane knows its immersive sim stuff. Despite the disappointing AI and some serious PC port issues, it still is one of the most fun experiences you can afford yourself this year and a breath of fresh air in the industry.                            
90	                                It seems that repetition is winning the day, so if at first you don't succeed try try again. The complexities and permutations in Deathloop are initially overwhelming and confusing, the intro attempts to explain so much by way of plot, mechanics and characterisation in a very short space of time. However, work past this point and the fun begins, with a sense of exploration and an arsenal of weapons and attacks making combat feel very rewarding. The story, despite at times being told through messages and text is well voiced acted, despite the incessant need to swear. Pulling off stealth kills or killing one of the eight main characters after figuring out how to infiltrate their plans makes players feel they have outwitted their computer counterpart. If there was one title to buy on PlayStation 5 right now that is truly next gen, then make sure Deathloop is at the top of that list.                            
90	                                It is the point of convergence for all the stuff you might expect of “a game” in 2021, wrapped in a stylish, meticulously-constructed package.                            
90	                                A concept that originally seems daunting, once you get into the central mechanic of Deathloop, it all makes sense. Be prepared to die again and again, remapping the same perpetual day out in a variety of different ways to hunt your targets. Arkane have refined their craft once more, delivering a densely packed world with so, so much to do. And as always, an insane variety in how to kill and look good doing it.                            
90	                                Once Deathloop steps back and lets you explore Blackreef in your own way, you’re presented with an expertly crafted world that changes as you poke and prod away at it. By doubling down on a handful of mechanics, Deathloop is a much sleeker, much more immediate experience than other Arkane games. I’d struggle to pick out a sub-par moment, or a target that was anything less than iconic. I feel that with Deathloop, one of the world’s best studios has put its best foot forward, offering up a painstakingly curated selection of reasons why it simply does it better than most. Deathloop is the most compelling reason to buy a PS5 yet, and a game that is destined to be referenced by future titles for years to come.                            
90	                                Deathloop is a game that takes the ideas driving the immersive sim genre to new heights. Purists may take issue with the way it breaks from some of the genre's traditions, but what it offers instead is something unlike anything else out there: a cleverly implemented time loop system that feeds into everything else, and opens the doors to a whole lot of new opportunities for the creative problem solving that sits at the heart of these games. That it does it all with a sense of style and confidence that few other games can match is icing on the cake.                            
90	                                There’s a hell of a lot to love about Deathloop. It’s seriously slick; taking control of Colt as he runs, slides, sneaks or climbs through an environment feels incredible. It’s a game that entrusts players to engage with its systems in their own way, and while you’ll never be at a loss on what to do, you won’t have your hand held, either. It’s fast, it’s smooth, it’s incredibly good fun. Chances are, you really won’t want the loop to end.                            
90	                                Deathloop expertly blends genres for a truly unique experience that delivers on its brilliant premise. Whether you’re sneaking around enemies, battling other players in surprise PvP shoot-outs, solving environmental puzzles, or uncovering clues to solve the mysteries of Blackreef island, it’s almost impossible to avoid Deathloop’s charm.                            
90	                                Deathloop is still signature Arkane in terms of exemplary immersive-sim design, reminiscent of BioShock and Dishonored, but it also puts a giant smile on your face each and every time you play.                            
90	                                Deathloop is one of the most innovative games from a major publisher that I’ve ever played, using the time loop mechanic to fantastic effect. With lots of clever puzzles and engaging combat, as well as a genius multiplayer element, this is one of the best games of 2021 yet.                             
90	                                Playing Deathloop is a joy in almost every way. Arkane Studios has successfully built upon what made their earlier games good and made something that feel both unique and stylish.                            
90	                                Deathloop was an awe-inspiring experience, and as such, it's a guaranteed candidate to the Game of the Year award. The game brings everything you can wish for - a great story, a world full of secrets begging to be discovered, unique characters, satisfying combat and puzzles, and timeless audiovisuals. Instant classic.                            
90	                                Deathloop is a very well crafted game that can be appealing to the majority of players, especially the fans of action and stealth genres. A solid gameplay structure combined with a mysterious story, beautiful visuals, memorable voice acting and very high replay values make the final package a must have.                            
90	                                Arkane did it again. Deathloop is a deep and greatly fun immersive sim in disguise, with strong characters, an interesting narrative and a beautifully handcrafted creative gameplay. Blackreef is a wonderful playground where freedom really matters and where amazing happens.                            
90	                                Deathloop has an innovative game concept, a gripping narrative and it'sspiced up with Arkane Studios' customary strong points.                            
90	                                Deathloop is one of the best games of 2021 and one of the best PS5 console exclusives so far. Arkane has hit it out of the park yet again, with the PS5 getting yet another must-have title for its growing library of exclusive games. Deathloop may be too easy and there's definitely some tedium tied to the time loop, but most of the time players will be having so much fun that they'll easily be able to overlook its few shortcomings.                            
90	                                Deathloop is a killer new-generation showcase that will keep you guessing until the very end.                            
90	                                Deathloop is one of the best works from Arkane Studios. An adventure that relies on trial and error, level repetition and pure emergent exploration to discover all the secrets of the loop and the story of Colt and Julianna. A PS5 must-have (right now) that proves Arkane always knows what it's doing.                            
90	                                Deathloop is an unusual but fascinating game to be experienced in one breath as a superb noir thriller in which, however, we are the killer. The AI is out of place compared to the rest of the game and it's not a perfect game, but it's not afraid to dare, it has style in spades, shows the creative team’s burning passion in every corner and when finally get that perfect loop, the satisfaction is immeasurable.                            
90	                                Deathloop is a bloody, chaotic mess. A mess you will fail at over and over until finally, you succeed. And that success – the result of hours of experimentation, iteration, and knowledge – makes for one of the best games of the year.                            
90	                                Deathloop takes Arkane's well known brand of first-person action stealth and artfully melds it into a time-bending multi-assassination power fantasy.                            
90	                                Deathloop proves that the concept of Groundhog Day also works in games. The story is phenomenal, mostly thanks due to the excellent voice-acting. Arkane focuses again on stealth, but also gives the play more options for all-out warfare, with a plethora of guns, special powers, and upgrades. The stay on Blackreef Island can get a little bit repetitive after multiple time loops, but the island itself is beautifully crafted, and the ending makes it all worth it. Arkane once again hit it out of the park.                            
90	                                If you've been waiting for the PlayStation 5's first true killer app, this is it. Deathloop is an innovative and satisfying take on the shooter genre that you can't afford to miss. Developer Arkane Studios has managed to take Dishonored's rock-solid foundation and hone it to a razor's edge. With a rewarding progression system and a gameplay loop that encourages experimentation and exploration, you can't help but wonder why Colt would ever want to break this cycle. Sprawling, cerebral, and consistently exciting, Deathloop deserves a spot in every shooter fan's PS5 library.                            
90	                                Although there are some elements from Dishonored in the game, Arkane Studios delivers a unique FPS, with great characters an intriguing story and a wise use of time loops. There are some technical issues here and there, but we loved the experience.                            
90	                                An awesome story, nice gameplay, beautiful characters and a lot of freedom. Deathloop is something really unique and special, a game that we will play again and again in an infinite loop.                            
90	                                It’s not an easy thing Arkane has done here in serving up a genuinely fresh take on one of the medium’s most enduring genres. Deathloop redefines what a shooter can be, and the developer has used their entire toolkit to get there. Satisfying action, world-building that’s second-to-none, style and substance, and a genuinely enthralling riddle at the centre, Deathloop delivers it all. And it’s through these triumphs that Deathloop earns its place in the first-person shooter pantheon, and puts its hand up during Game of the Year talks.                            
90	                                Mixing stealth, weighty gunplay, supernatural powers, and play-your-way weapons and gadgets, Deathloop is a greatest-hits amalgam of Arkane style with a splash of grindhouse grittiness and a satisfying murder puzzle narrative to put it apart from anything that has come before.                            
90	                                We've played the concept of "eternal return" in video games for decades, but Deathloop gives it a unique twist and turns it into a central part of its mechanics and plot. Repeating their trusted and tried formula, Arkane Studios improved on it until Deathloop came to be; and while not perfect, it's only a few loops away from it.                            
90	                                Deathloop follows the same pattern regarding the most characteristic elements to be found on Arkane's portfolio: a superb level design, an exceptional gameplay, an interesting story and an artistic element nothing short of spectacular. A magnificent game with but a few 'but' that has managed to completely hook me from beginning to end.                            
90	                                Deathloop takes Arkane’s fantastic level design and world building and adds and interesting story with great characters on top, leaving you in a time loop that you won’t want to break.                            
90	                                Saying Deathloop plays with the form isn’t mere hyperbole. In much the same way great films defy comparison, or push their respective artform forward, Deathloop does so for the first-person shooter. By pairing the idea of ‘where to go’ and ‘how to approach’ with that of a deep underlying mystery, Deathloop is as dense a puzzle to solve as it is a combat playground to conquer.                            
90	                                Deathloop is an excellent game with a very neat universe and intelligent mechanics that make the experience addictive. The gameplay is perfect and the multiple possibilities at the heart of the different neighborhoods and hours of the day make it possible to never get bored; on the contrary, it is extremely satisfying to advance and progress through the failures. The powers and the way we improve are awesome and make this game a real nugget. Bravo Arkane!                            
90	                                If you thought Groundhog Day would have been even more awesome with guns and assassinations or that Dishonored would have been a better game if only Quentin Tarantino had directed it, you’d probably enjoy Deathloop. Despite some issues with pacing, bugs, AI, and mechanical clarity, Deathloop is smart, funny, intricately designed, and driven by engaging action, cool puzzles, and relative freedom to approach its objectives in various ways. Deathloop is an addictive and rewarding shooter and one of the most ambitious action games this year.                            
90	                                Deathloop is my biggest surprise of the year. While it might be expected that Arkane would craft another high-quality experience, I'm personally astonished by how much the studio's latest release has clicked with me. Even though it might have a lot of common DNA with what Arkane has done before, the sheer amount of style and inventiveness that can be found in Deathloop makes it stand out greatly in a crowded video game market. If you're looking for something completely different compared to everything else that has released this year, Deathloop is absolutely worth getting lost in.                            
90	                                Deathloop combines a classic Arkane stealthy-shooty foundation with a genuinely interesting and fun premise.                            
90	                                Deathloop is a well-crafted, intelligent murder puzzle worth solving, regardless of your experience with immersive sims or roguelikes. There are a few bugs at launch though.                            
89	                                As most of the former Arkane titles, Deathloop is far away from being a game off the rack. The unique setting with its great artstyle makes it stand out. The fast paced Dishonored-like gameplay is fun as well as if you choose the action or the stealth path. If there weren't some issues concerning balancing or the overall poor AI, Deathloop would be close to a masterpiece. As it is, it's just another great game from Arkane Lyon that's worth to play.                            
87	                                A game with a remarkable finish that we will enjoy and remember. A good buy, highly recommended for lovers of the genre. It is well cared for at all levels.                             
85	                                Deathloop is a bizarre fever-dream that's too fun to wake up from. An absurd, retrofuturistic murder-mystery where you don't solve the murders, but commit them. Leave it to Arkane Studios to make such a surreal world feel real.                            
85	                                Deathloop is an engaging and enjoyable game that manages to capture the feel of Dishonored in a more fast-paced adventure. The unique setting and engaging concept carry the game through the repetitive nature of the gameplay. The multiplayer at the center of the story is more of a mixed bag but still intriguing enough to be memorable. Some annoying bugs drag down the experience. If you liked Dishonored but wished it were less about stealth and more about blowing things up, then Deathloop is the game for you. Just be prepared to die again and again.                            
85	                                Deathloop is not only this year, but one of the most original and different productions we have come across recently. It is really enjoyable to see the map in different ways at different times of the day and to try to complete this big puzzle with the clues you find.                            
85	                                Deathloop is an awesomely entertaining ride with stealth and puzzle elements that help make it feel like the big crazy sci-fi adventure it wants to be.                            
85	                                Deathloop is a fantastic game full of surprises. It’s unique design and its brilliant execution offer an adventure that feels fresh and different, and it’s a game that you need to try if you’re looking for something that feels known but new at the same time.                            
85	                                Deathloop is for detective nerds who just want to blow shit up. Each moment of this game offers some insane new plot twists and discoveries that further highlights how amazing the writing is. Players are rewarded through exploration, but at the cost that they could lose it all if they die in the process. It's an experience that demands a keen eye and patience at times to unlock everything it has to offer, but at least the dumb enemies will rarely get in your way.                            
85	                                Deathloop offers up a highly enjoyable gameplay loop shrouded in mystery.                            
85	                                A unique and intriguing way to present the idea of time travel in a game. If you're a fan of this concept like me, you will love this objective based first person gift from Arkane.                            
85	                                DEATHLOOP won't be a game for everyone—however, if you are a fan of sandbox styled titles or if you just like games like Dishonored, DEATHLOOP is a familiar feeling experience presented in a unique way that makes it feel fresh and fun to play.                            
83	                                Deathloop chooses to keep an ambitious and unique premise playable and that sometimes hinders your mental freedom of movement. However, it manages to keep a game in which repetition is ingrained, entertaining, fascinating and often intense.                            
82	                                A cool timeloop thriller with great characters and a lot of freedom, but also some small AI issues and other nuisances.                             
82	                                Deathloop is based on Dishonored foundations and uses many of its level design tropes. It must be considered a smaller project, but a very brilliant one, with very good ideas and an intriguing game concept.                            
82	                                Deathloop is an original, visionary and courageous work, a playful experiment that returns to reaffirm the unquestionable talent of the Arkane Studios team, which over the years has never stopped putting itself to the test with ever new challenges, often at odds with the commercial logic of the triple A market. The result of the studio's latest creative challenge is a brilliant exercise in game design, at the base of a multifaceted and compelling playful narrative construct, blessed with an absolutely majestic artistic direction. Deathloop is a unique game of its kind, which unfortunately is torn from excellence by some rather important flaws. First of all, a surprisingly lazy and anticlimatic conclusion, which ends up revealing some evident gaps in the script. Even on the playful side, not everything works perfectly, especially due to an artificial intelligence that is not very reactive and too erratic. Net of its missteps, however, Deathloop remains a memorable work, a jumble of style and creativity probably destined to become an instant cult.                             
80	                                Deathloop offers a fun, time bending romp. The story is intriguing and the characters, butterfly effects and abilities are the strong points only hampered by a lot of repetition and the odd technical hitch.                            
80	                                Deathloop’s mind-bending time mechanic, captivating art style, open-ended gameplay, and colorful cast of characters create a captivating shooter experience that you shouldn’t miss.                            
80	                                Unfortunately, the weak recon missions made too easy by the lack of challenge from AI enemies, the small number of maps that are quickly mastered, and the limited variety in gameplay burdened by uninspired upgrades, ultimately prevent Deathloop from reaching the highest of highs. With online multiplayer enabled and embraced, however, it becomes easier to overlook the weak points and Deathloop comes out on the other side as a compelling lesson in how intimate multiplayer can greatly enhance the single-player formula.                            
80	                                Deathloop is another hit from the talented Arkane Studios, albeit with some noticeable shortcomings. It’s especially peculiar that the A.I. is -simply put- bad, considering that Prey and especially Dishonored 2 where some of the highest quality games in this aspect. Nevertheless, the loop system where we live the same day again and again is cleverly implemented and utilized leading to an unforgettable and unique experience.                            
80	                                Arkane Studios latest shooter grabs you directly with it's mix of smart gameplay and mysterious storytelling. While the time loop concept is engaging, it's the freedom of mixing between various gameplay styles that makes Deathloop more addicting than other games in the same genre. Although it can get a little tedious with the large amount of intel that is dropped simultaneous from time to time.                             
80	                                So to experience all the good of Deathloop you need also suck it up and suffer a bit of bad. Nothing too stinky, just enough to make you intermittently wrinkle your nose. But it’s worth it. Arkane’s newest isn’t perfect, but I suspect it will end up one of the most memorable games of 2021 simply because it’s so unlike everything out there at the moment. In a season of sequels and various licensed properties, it’s a treat to get to play something as original and unexpected as this.                            
80	                                New and refreshing, Arkane Studios delivers quite a unique experience with Deathloop. Expert level design, interesting targets and a wide variety of gameplay options make for one hell of a title. And it looks great to boot! Some technical imperfections should be mentioned, however… as well as the bit underwhelming experience that is playing as Julianna. Nothing is perfect though, right?                            
80	                                If there is something lacking in Deathloop, it has to do with emotional staying power. As one egghead, in a scratchy projector film, began to unreel the mythology (“Long ago, the isle of Blackreef experienced a cataclysmic event which tore the fabric of”—and so forth), I realised that I couldn’t care less. Blackreef can go hang. I suspect that the only things that will stick with me—the only things coated with enough Residuum to survive a hard reset—are Colt and Julianna. And maybe that isn’t all bad news. I may replay it at some point, and when I do I’ll be even more like Colt, waking on a beach with the vague prickle of familiarity, and the need to break free.                            
80	                                Those of us who love to get into the game, learn more about its world and eavesdrop, read emails on terminals and rack our brains to get into places without being shot at, are in luck: with Deathloop we have a great game for a while.                            
80	                                Arkane serves a successful evolution of their older concepts, which will entertain with variability, delight with stylization and excite with action. Too bad it is too much guidance and inconsistent artificial intelligence.                             
80	                                A rich and diversified gameplay is at the heart of Deathloop, the like Arkane is known for, but the studio, or Bethesda is too shy of letting the player explore by himself et ruin the pleasure of exploration. Also, the invasion mechanism is a little too... invasive.                            
80	                                Glitches like these will be ironed out with a patch, luckily, and Deathloop is definitely for the gamers who rootle around for the secrets in games. Here, though, every scrap of paper and scoop weakens the chains that keep Blackreef suspended in time. As your experience grows of the ins and outs of the island, you'll maximise the hours you have and become a force unto yourself, shuffling Eternalists off their mortal coil in creative ways. All of this feels fantastic, so hats off to Arkane for setting themselves and the players an exciting, rewarding, and ambitious challenge that they won't forget.                             
80	                                Comfortable in the exercise of style imposed by the time loop, the artists of Arkane signed with Deathloop a very good FPS that is as interesting as it is wacky. More action-oriented than a Dishonored, Bethesda's title quickly reaches a level of depth but also of complexity that is rare even for a work by Arkane. The repetitive aspect necessarily linked to the theme of the game is intelligently lessened by the variety of situations, the chance of encounters (with Julianna) and the rise in power. Enjoying a concept of loop without running out of time, Deathloop encourages experiments of all kinds in a universe that contrasts drastically with what the people of Lyon have already produced. And it's good to see that the studio doesn't sing us the same song ... over and over.                             
80	                                Deathloop absolutely has its issues, but none of them ultimately get in the way of the experience the game is trying to provide. There is so much delicious freedom available that you really feel as though you get to form your own identity in the game. It's a point that's made abundantly clear as you study the various playstyles of the people who invade you as well as the ones you invade. Arkane has built a reputation on making smart games that play as well as they're designed, and Deathloop is only further evidence of that fact.                            
80	                                Deathloop, summarized, is "Arkane does Hitman." It glorifies its repetition, and never feels unrewarding, especially when taking down a player-controlled Juliana. I want to re-immerse myself in its world, pick apart its secrets, and master its systems. Not everything works seamlessly, but taken as a whole it's an immersive sim sandbox of unmatched proportions.                             
80	                                Deathloop playfully bends the rules of its genre, thanks to being steered by the steady hands of the people who helped write those rules in the first place. Action-stealth games tend toward homogeny, but Deathloop wisely forces you to play smarter — and feel smarter as a result.                            
80	                                Few games have the confidence and swagger of Deathloop. Packed full of charisma and wit, it's a game that can be played your way, with your own style and cunning. A very accomplished package of gameplay features supplies the goods, and the time loop delivers fun and deceitful opportunities over and over again. Deathloop may be the final game out of Arkane Studios to hit Sony consoles, but the developer goes out with an undisputed bang.                            
80	                                Deathloop is a promising evolutive step for one of the greatest developers in the industry. Like every attempt to change it has some structural flaws but this inventive FPS/stealth deserves everybody's attention. A fascinating muder puzzle bond to a time loop.                            
80	                                Consistency is the mother of mastery. And DEATHLOOP is another consistent release of Arkane Studios. For newcomers this game can serve as a great entry point to the Arkane portfolio. While all the hadcore fans will surely get what they expect from this title, even with this new and experimental format. There's no better place for experiments than in the endless time loop, after all.                            
80	                                Deathloop is a great game, if kind of a mixed bag in ways. On one hand, the gameplay is some of the most refined Arkane has done, and they give you almost an “easy mode roguelite” to play, along with a little opposition via co-op for spice. On the other however, the story can stumble, and the grind can be a bit too monotonous. Deathloop walks a bit of a fine line, but overall has enough fun ideas to keep things mostly fresh and fun for Colt and Julianna players alike.                            
70	                                Deathloop brings a considerable measure of liveliness to the by now moth-eaten concept of the time loop.                            
70	                                In the end, Deathloop is a pretty decent ride with a fantastic sense of style and a lot of freedom for players to experience Colt’s story as they see fit. However, the overall experience is shaken by a surprising amount of bugs, braindead enemy artificial intelligence, lackluster PVP and by-design repetition as Colt works to piece together the mystery of Blackreef. I largely enjoyed my time, though I was very ready for Colt’s day to end as I neared the campaign’s finale, and it’s unlikely I’ll be looping back into the game for more any time soon.                            
70	                                I never felt any urgency to break the time loop since everyone in the world — even Colt — is pretty blithe about going through the motions from one loop to the next. Alas, I find it difficult to imagine anyone who isn’t partial to video game tropes loving Deathloop. Unless you’re particularly drawn to its vibe, it’s a shooter with good mechanics but not much more than that.                            
70	                                Deathloop is far from being the sum of my worst fears, but it went into a direction that does turn it into a mixed experience. There are some good ideas in the game, but repetition kills most of the fun. Still, it is not a bad game.If you have the patience to put together the story you will find it quite appealing, the level design is as brilliant as ever, but on the other hand the maps are really small, and the combat system is half baked. Overall if you expect another Prey or Dishonored you will be disappointed, but if you are looking for an action game that is quirky and different you might have fun with it.                            
70	                                Deathloop is a tremendously stylish stealth-action game that builds on Arkane's strengths, even if some of its creative gambles fall flat.                            
70	                                Not quite a misfire but while the action is highly entertaining this time-looping adventure squanders much of its premise on disappointingly straightforward objectives and a curiously tame portrayal of unchecked hedonism.                            
70	                                If your prefer your time-looping adventures to be more stylish and violence-oriented, then Deathloop may be for you. Even with its various issues, there is satisfaction to be had in learning each map and completing the perfect series of assassinations.                            
70	                                For fans of the modern Hitman series, Arkane's outstanding catalog, and great-feeling FPS games in general, Deathloop is highly recommended.                            
60	                                Deathloop is in a weird spot. It isn't as good as Dishonored, but I also don't expect to see another game in the series. If you want to support the studio or need a Dishonored fix, this will help...but honestly, the game isn't that fun.                            
90	                                Kitaria Fables is an incredibly fun RPG that combines the exploration and fighting style of Zelda with the farming and village gameplay of Stardew Valley and the cute animal characters of Animal Crossing. I played this for hours at a time, unable to put it down.                            
82	                                If you’re a fan of games like Harvest Moon, Stardew Valley and Rune Factory, you’ll definitely like this title. It has a decent balance of farming and adventure, a solid story and the most adorable characters you will ever see. Since the game is pretty open, you can really go at your own pace, you don’t have to do any of the story quests right away if you feel like opting towards farming and gathering instead. Or if you think you can get away with a limited income, you can mostly forgo the farming and head straight into the adventure! Overall, Kitaria Fables is a wholesome and relaxed time.                            
80	                                A fantastic tribute to Fantasy Life that nails the kind of grindy combat that many people love, Kitaria Fables is genuinely sweet and impressively well-made for a three-person team in under three years. If Fantasy Life is a Wagyu beef steak, Kitaria Fables is a really, REALLY good burger. If you're jonesing for a tasty action-farming-adventure, Kitaria Fables has you covered.                            
80	                                Kitaria Fables is a warm, genuine delight. It’s not trying to tell you something deep about the world. Nor is it looking to spark debates over hard modes or subversion. It’s not aiming to challenge, belittle, insult or offend. The game’s just there to give people of all ages a chance to go on fun little quests together, as adorable little animals, with a garden of veggie delights to look forward to coming back to. It might just be the sweetest and most innocent Rune Factory or Harvest Moon I’ve come across, and that’s really saying something, since this entire "genre", such as it is, is entirely built up around wholesomeness.                            
74	                                Kitiara Fables is a fun action RPG, with significant time spent farming in between quests. Though there are some issues with couch co-op, the story is still entertaining enough to recommend a look.                            
60	                                Kitaria Fables does a lot of things well, and a few things a little less well. It’s cute and colourful, and the adventuring is absorbing, but the farming falls a little flat.                            
60	                                Kitaria Fables feels like a short and sweet game stretched needlessly long, robbing the game of a lot of the fun it’s cutesy art style promises. But fans of similar genres, and people with a lot of time and patience, might well fall in love with this game.                            
50	                                Kitaria Fables had everything to be cool, but ended up wanting to do too many things, and sinned even for the most basic aspects of a game.                            
50	                                Despite the need for quality-of-life improvements, Kitaria Fables will likely appeal to fans of the RPG genre for its cute story, engaging graphics, and diverse mechanics. However, fans of farming simulation titles may want to wait until patches have been implemented to make the feature more beneficial to the overall gameplay.                            
90	                                Lake is a truly beautiful narrative adventure. The sound design is excellent and the story progresses in a delicate way, with feeling. An oasis of relaxation in a chaotic world that is always in a hurry.                            
80	                                Lake amazes for its coherence and compactness, for its essential and at the same time deep and melancholy nature.                             
80	                                There is no question Lake is rather ordinary, but it’s precisely that ordinariness that lets it shine despite its flaws. Delivering mail and driving around the same familiar streets can easily get monotonous, and a few design choices ruin some of the relaxation that comes from the job, but it makes up for it in the unique interactions between Meredith and other characters. Their outcomes may not be groundbreaking, but it serves to tell a story about the normalcy of life and the choices we make to find happiness in what we are doing.                            
80	                                A fantastic feat of storytelling and character building in relatively short time, Lake demands to be played. Compelling narratives and characters unfold beautifully and organically in an adventure game that lets the player cobble together their own tales of Providence Oaks.                            
76	                                Lake has a message and it knows how to communicate it. The real problem is Lake has a videogame: it would have benefited from a major complexity.                            
75	                                A charming journey into the American countryside. It's not the most original gaming experience and there are a few bugs that still needs solving, but thanks to its rich atmosphere and interesting characters Lake still manages to provide half a dozen hours of good entertainment.                            
75	                                Personal grievances aside, I think Lake succeeds in its aims, and that’s the important thing. It set out to be a slice of small-town life, and that’s what it is. I think there’s a rather narrow audience for that kind of thing, but it will be perfect for those who know what they’re getting into. If you think you’d be into a narrative about escaping the city life, then here it is. The writing is solid, the production values are decent for its asking price, so it’s worthwhile to check out of that’s your thing. As for me, I’m just eager to get back to the city.                            
75	                                A generally enjoyable narrative game with strong characters and writing, Lake is a pleasant way to pass the time when its technical faults aren't making things difficult.                            
73	                                I don’t regret my stay in Providence Oaks, but like most vacations, I wish I had gotten to do more in the short time I had with the game. If you’re looking for a slice-of-life experience in a peaceful lake town and you don’t mind some bumps along the road, Lake might just be up your alley. If you want a narrative game with replay value where your choices affect the story, this vacation might leave you a little wanting.                             
70	                                Between the walking simulator, and the video game experience, Lake is a contemplative title that takes advantage of rather well-written characters, and a system of dialogues enough impacting for us to think about the meaning of life and its priorities. No choice is better than the other, which means that the title really lets us choose what we want, without it having a positive or negative impact on the gaming experience. The sublime artistic direction, the incredible landscapes, and the chill soundtrack are a perfect setting for such a reflection. Lake could almost be reimbursed by social security because its soothing virtues are numerous. Unfortunately, a few bugs tarnish the picture, while we admit to having trouble releasing the 20 € requested for 6 hours of play, with very low replayability. In short, hop on Lake in a few months, after a few patches, and during a promo.                             
70	                                You won't want to leave Lake when the credits roll, such is the splendour of its setting and the welcome warmth of so many people who call this place home (assuming you weren't a dick to everyone). But you'll wish its flashes of understated majesty and its softly spoken introspective exchanges weren't compromised by performance that's woefully inconsistent. But if Gamious manages to patch this into a steadier experience, you can add a point, or even two, to the score below. Because there's something special here, beneath the creaks and the cracks.                            
70	                                Lake is a peaceful narrative adventure that interestingly enough, is better at its art and gameplay than its narrative.                            
70	                                Lake is an extremely charming story-driven title where you can accidentally be so nice to everyone that you end up forgetting to live for yourself. For the right kind of person, that in and of itself can be a much-needed wake up call; for everyone else, it’s in the very least a soothing little mail-carrying simulator that allows you to set the pace. If you’re looking for some slice-of-life goodness that provides some chill and calming ambiance, taking it easy with Lake is a no-brainer.                            
70	                                Does Lake push the boundaries and redefine the genre of a narrative adventure? I wouldn’t say so, but I would contend that it’s a welcome addition. The game is a great exploration of the impact one can have on others’ lives with simple interactions in a peaceful manner. There are quality-of-life issues, and the impact may not be as great as you would hope. In fact, there’s nothing grandiose about the game, but that works in its favor–it’s a calming presence in a world of chaos.                            
60	                                We're very happy with the ending we land on, but it's hard to imagine anyone choosing to stick around. [Issue#364, p.121]                            
60	                                In the end, Lake delivers on producing a "slice of life" experience but with some issues that keep it from being excellent. The characters are interesting to talk to, even if only a few of them break out from being one-dimensional. The vocal performances are good, but the stiff facial and body animations and rushed story don't give it a chance to connect with players. If you can forgive these shortcomings and don't find the mail delivery mechanic to be tedious, Lake is relaxing and different enough from other offerings to warrant a glance.                            
60	                                Lake tells a beautiful story, has nuanced and interesting characters, and has an environment that feels comforting and inviting. What detracts from the experience is, unfortunately, the game's tedious tasks and slow pace. This combination makes it hard to leave the experience with a clear opinion about the time spent in Providence Oaks, but what is clear is that Lake will absolutely satisfy players who feel like they need to escape and spend some time taking it slow and easy.                            
75	                                The Good Life is a strange mix of photography-game and life-sim, and while it's not perfect, its flaws are covered by a weirdly charming premise.                            
70	                                The Good Life can be summed up as one of the more polished SWERY experiences. For some, that explains all they need to know; for everyone else, it’s like a fun, repetitive, sweet and sour mixture between Little Dragons Cafe, Animal Crossing, Harvest Moon, Pokemon Snap, No More Heroes III, and Katamari Damacy. So few games leave me at a loss for words like The Good Life did, yet this is somehow one of my longest articles. As a gamedev and reviewer, I’m confused. As a gamer, I’m content.                            
70	                                The Good Life knows where its strengths lie. Its functional open-world model and mostly-dated gameplay systems sit quietly in the background and allow its quirky charm to take the spotlight. That charm is piled on thick, with absurd characters (and absurd accents), a plot that digresses so wildly it seems unable to remember where it started and, lest we forget, the whole dog/cat transmogrification thing. The charm and atmosphere have to be seriously compelling if they are to excuse the well-worn mechanics, repetitive tasks and frequent slowdown and pop-in. If Japanese old-school gaming whimsy × twee Englishness isn't for you, then neither is The Good Life. But if you're a SWERY fan and that sounds like your cup of tea, get dunking.                            
69	                                The Good Life is a Swery game, with all the good and the bad things that implies. Sure, there are issues, but also plenty of memorable moments.                            
60	                                The photography element is the best part of the game, and even though you don’t get a whole lot of specific feedback on your shots, it’s entertaining to try to take shots that will get a lot of virtual social media attention. A great game? No, but not without its charms.                            
60	                                Tedious amounts of fetch quests, clunky controls, sloppy presentation/execution, outdated visuals, and a mediocre soundtrack are really hard things to ignore, especially when considering the $29.99 price point. All in all, I’ve heard a lot about SWERY’s games and was looking forward to this experience, so it’s a bummer it fell short.                             
60	                                When everything is flowing in The Good Life, it feels like a touch of Animal Crossing with alternatingly quaint and irreverent British pastoral television, all with a burgeoning murder mystery underneath. Unfortunately, some of its rougher edges seem possibly related to the Switch itself and, although loading times are usually on the shorter side, their frequent appearance interrupts the flow even more. The Rainy Woods residents are charming and strange and there’s a numbingly pleasant feel to smalltown life and chores, but stiff controls and muddled design make it hard to find a good rhythm in The Good Life.                            
54	                                There is a ton of stuff to do in The Good Life, even multiple main storylines to pursue. Unfortunately, completing them and fulfilling the side missions is not very fun. Between the constant back and forth across the huge map and the fetch quests, I feel that more in-depth gameplay features would really help me enjoy this game.                            
50	                                Quotation forthcoming.                            
50	                                Despite the good will of the developer, The Good Life simply can't make it to the sufficiency. Unfortunately, too many design and technical problems keep this game far from a decent gaming experience. There are a couple of good things to mention, but are overshadowed by unexplainable design mistakes.                            
50	                                There is just a lot to do in The Good Life, which means that players can potentially sink upwards of forty-plus hours taking pictures or running mundane, everyday tasks. And while I like life simulators, I don’t like them when they can barely run at over 3 FPS. With a story that lacks focus and with these elements largely feeling like padding, The Good Life doesn’t stand out in any significant way.                            
47	                                Despite having some interesting moments, The Good Life feels and plays like a crazy mess.                            
45	                                While there’s still some ramshackle charm and memorable silliness to be had, The Good Life takes every opportunity to sell itself short and make playing it a frustrating, repetitive, and user-antagonistic experience.                            
40	                                The Good Life has a name behind it in SWERY, and as such, the story brings all the insanity and the confusion one has come to expect from his previous titles.  There is scope for the humour to work, but factoring in fighting with the camera and struggling with the controls the whole experience is just not worthwhile.  In a self-fulling prophecy, Naomi points out a lot of faults in games that The Good Life just blithely repeats itself.  Throwing a crazy ad-lib together and keeping fingers crossed the game works may have worked in the past, but this game has none of the fun or the charm to be successful nowadays.                            
40	                                The Good Life, for better or intentionally worse, is full of hardships. It might be the kind of experience you're looking for if you wanted a reflection of just how laborious life can be sometimes. That might not make for a very good life, though.                            
40	                                The Good Life is a product plagued by major problems on the playful and structural side. A title extremely lacking from a technical point of view, which brings to the screen a series of decidedly questionable game design choices, at the basis of an adventure that, while trying to tell a story in its own way mature, often ends in boredom and struggles to support the player's interest.                             
20	                                A hugely disappointing mess of a game that magnifies all of SWERY’s worst tendencies and fails to compensate in terms of the unengaging characters and script.                            
80	                                Singular and therefore quite striking, "JETT Le Rivage Lointain" in French in the text, is a journey that should not be missed. It will not remain as a lasting memory that will mark the life of a player forever. It looks more like that nice walk we took on the weekend and which leaves vivid memories. It is a game that has a soul and brilliantly composes a striking musical and aesthetic blend.                             
80	                                Jett: The Far Shore deftly blends exploration and narrative elements, telling a story of struggle and hope against the odds. Small issues aside, the game shines with great writing and believable characters who press on even as challenges arise.                            
70	                                Jett: Far From Shore has some epic highs but fiddly ship controls and unanswered questions weigh this space adventure down.                            
68	                                Jett: The Far Shore shines bright in some narrative-heavy sections, and its visuals can be impressive, but – despite starting off full of potential – it fails to fulfill its promise. Sadly, Jett’s finale, much like my time spent piloting its interstellar spacecraft, feels more unfulfilling than thought-provoking.                            
58	                                JETT: The Far Shore has so much potential wasted due to its abysmal gameplay, the same gameplay that hinders the overall experience and undermines what good has been done on the artistic and narrative sides of the game.                            
55	                                JETT: The Far Shore, which I entered with great expectations, manages to distract the player from the game with its bad dialogue design and storytelling.                            
50	                                JETT: The Far Shore is a strange game, with superficial game mechanics and an incredible anxiety to fill empty moments with something meaningful, without ever fully succeeding.                            
40	                                It must be said, I was absolutely blindsided by JETT: The Far Shore. The marketing was vague enough that I could envision this game working. The aesthetic that I found so dazzling is still there, but everything else falls by the wayside. At best, the gameplay teased me with what could have been. At its worst, it was a frustrating and laborious mess. Storywise, there were few sparks of interest to be found. Should something catch alight, it would be quickly smothered by boring office chatter. It’s the purest form of a game that presents itself as a well-designed art piece. JETT: The Far Shore is something to ogle at, to mull over, to discuss. It has no desire to lower itself to the medium of video games, and the mechanical tedium bears that out.                            
100	                                The Artful Escape has been in the works since around 2015, and the effort shows. The game is precise in what it wants to portray and doesn't overstay its welcome. It tells a contained story about one guy, his famous uncle, and the whole of the cosmos, and does it well. It's also a story about the power of music, the art of creating, and the journey to becoming your true self. You can take what you want from it, make it one of your best comfort games if you want, but at the very least, it's a cool game to look at. It'll look great as one of the best Xbox games joining Xbox Game Pass this month.                            
100	                                The Artful Escape is a story about legacies, finding yourself, change and transition that presents itself in such an ingenious way that all can absolutely enjoy it. Gliding across the cosmos, playing electric guitar in unknown lands, and eventually vanquishing a divine complication with intricate audio design and superb music to accompany – it’s perplexing how captivating this interstellar adventure is. Inviting players on a musical journey through cosmic realms and challenging introspection, The Artful Escape is a masterpiece.                            
90	                                By the time the final credits roll on The Artful Escape, it’s a challenge to succinctly summarise what you’ve just experienced. It’s a game without a genre, one composed of familiar elements blended in an unfamiliar way, creating something that is uniquely its own. It’s been a long time coming since The Artful Escape was given its initial glimpse of what was in store, but when it’s all said and done, it leaves the audience satisfied but still wanting just a little more. Like any good concert.                            
90	                                The Artful Escape definitely belongs to one of these games that appear almost out of nowhere, just to make us happy and blessed to try out. While not a title for platformer aficionados and those who crave for something challenging, The Artful Escape ends up being a pleasant surprise, and one that will stay within for long.                            
90	                                The Artful Escape tells a heartfelt story of artistic self-discovery through a filter of color, light, sound, and joy. Combining gonzo sci-fi imagery with blaring space-rock guitar chords, The Artful Escape is a playable concept album – or at least a grand trip through that album’s cover art. Never difficult but always fun, The Artful Escape is highly recommended as both a great narrative and a fun exploration into Bowie-style space rock imagery.                            
90	                                After almost 2 years without being able to attend a concert normally, those who claim to be music lovers have the opportunity with The Artful Escape to participate in what comes closest to it : a rock and roll narrative experience. Ready to battle with Psychonauts 2 for the title of the most colorful artistic direction of the year, puffing up with color and good humor, with a fantastic soundtrack, the first project of Beethoven & Dinosaur does not disappoint. His neat writing, his crazy ans so well interpreted characters and his themes largely allow him to forget that it has not a lot to offer gameplaywise. One of the sunrays of 2021, unmissable if you have always dreamed of becoming a rockstar and dazzling an audience in delirium with your most melodious riffs.                            
90	                                In the end, its expert cast, beautiful worlds, and clever writing together tell a very stimulating story of discovery, despite its otherwise quirky exterior.                            
90	                                The Artful Escape is a short but oh-so-sweet platformer that will have you bopping to its impossibly catch beats and transfixed by its beauty.                            
85	                                The Artful Escape is a hypnotic journey about legacy and self-discovery. The developers have managed to tell an inspiring story about being yourself no matter what. The journey is the perfect length and often surprised me with its tenderness and soul. Stunning visuals and a catchy soundtrack helped elevate the experience into something I don't think I will forget anytime soon.                            
85	                                A fantastic musical adventure with its unique, wacky style that clashes (in a good way) with a cosmic setting and emotional themes.                            
82	                                The Artful Escape is a powerful and aesthetically wonderful generational hymn, which sounds great and uses gameplay as a subtle way to give rhythm to a short, but intense, experience.                            
80	                                The Artful Escape might seem easy to some players, but its flawless and engaging music and art direction make it worth your time.                            
80	                                The Artful Escape is an exquisite experience in every aspect. The psychedelic nature of the story keeps things interesting, plus a visually appealing presentation and a great soundtrack.                            
80	The Artful Escape may lack depth of interactivity, but in the end, the game is more of a trippy coming-of-age story than it is a career mode in Rock Band.                            
80	                                Challenging as that may be, The Artful Escape is nevertheless a thrilling adventure that commits fully to showcasing its gorgeous art in soaring set pieces. Though some of the dialogue doesn’t work, the game is largely successful at stripping out anything that would distract from its masterful presentation. Unlike Francis Vendetti at the beginning of his journey, The Artful Escape knows exactly what it is.                            
80	                                The Artful Escape is an awesome musical experience but you need to accept this is something very similar to a walking simulator.                            
80	                                There hasn’t been a guitar-based adventure as excellent as The Artful Escape since Bill met Ted.                             
80	                                The Artful Escape provides a strong narrative adventure focused on self-discovery, identity, and expression that musicians, artists, and just about anyone can find something to relate to.                             
75	                                The Artful Escape focuses the attention on the narrative through a powerful audiovisual staging, reducing the platforms and the challenge to the minimum expression to provide the player with an authentic festival of rock, psychedelia and surrealism.                            
75	                                An eye-popping musical adventure that will leave you with a serious case of galaxy brain.                            
75	                                The Artful Escape is a visual and audio masterpiece that creates a sincere narrative that gives hope to any struggling would-be artist that they will find their own voice at the end of a tough journey. As good as that message might be, the gameplay mechanics don’t nearly live up to the hype the rest of the game creates.                            
75	                                Highly contemplative, utterly eccentric and absolutely magnificent, The Artful Escape offers a visual and sound experience that is as puzzling as it is thrilling. But the beauty of the abstract can reach its limits when the nonsense ends up losing us. And the journey sometimes runs out of steam when the gameplay remains on its way. However, the journey remains relatively captivating up and down, both for its beauty and its uniqueness. But there is no doubt that it will be divisive.                             
70	                                The Artful Escape perfectly encapsulates the feeling of being transported away by a David Bowie track to a far-out world filled with colorful characters and wildlife and great music, but its gameplay falls flat, offering little depth past its first tutorial. While the game is short enough for its systems to never feel too egregious, it never reaches its full potential through its story or its mechanics. Fans of zen games, nice visuals, and quippy dialogue may want to pick this up, but do not expect a deep experience in playing The Artful Escape.                            
70	                                The Artful Escape is a rockin' Space Opera but it doesn't have much going for it besides its pretty visuals and incredible music. The platforming is basic and the plot is serviceable, but it's nothing that audiences haven't seen before. I'd recommend this game only if you're a fan of rock music from the '70s and '80s.                            
70	                                The Artful Escape has a stellar narrative with actual good humour enhanced by the voice acting talent and beautiful landscapes, but the gameplay is stale and those who dislike electric guitar are in for a long haul.                            
65	                                I wanted to come away from The Artful Escape feeling inspired and changed, with a story to really mull over. I came into this four-to-five-hour experience with expectations set by early gameplay, and while some of them were met, I don't know that it does enough to really justify its choice of medium. It has got more than enough in terms of eye candy and audio bliss, but I can't confidently say that any of the other pieces manage to come together in this space oddity.                            
60	                                While The Artful Escape does a strong job with its presentation and sense of style, it still suffers the same drawbacks as most adventure games, particularly with the boring-at-best game mechanics. The celebrity voice cast does well enough, though I only recognized Weathers during my time in the game. The trip here isn’t long, though it does manage to be memorable thanks to its relentless desire to look like a Liz Frank-emblazoned Trapper Keeper. Depending on the drugs you keep handy, this could be the ticket.                            
40	                                When characters are suddenly reintroduced in the finale, it’s noticeable how little a dent they made in this feather-weight narrative. The story can be completed in a few hours, and there’s occasional amusement and distraction in those hours, but absolutely no catharsis or narrative satisfaction, or even any interesting platforming. For such a visually boisterous experience, The Artful Escape feels more like a chilly museum after closing hours.                            
84	                                Quotation forthcoming.                            
78	                                Killsquad is a game that evolved significantly since it first arrived onto Early Access two years ago, and the result is a solid twin-stick shooter with looter elements. When it comes to loot drops, the balance is unfortunately a bit off, but overall the game is a fun mix of genres.                            
75	                                After two years of early access, Killsquad is launching in a strong position to build on a solid, playable, and enjoyable foundation.                            
70	                                Killsquad is a good attempt at merging a few ideas from other genres and coming up with an arcade-style isometric shooter with a loot grind. The action loop is solid, and the high enemy count makes for some frantic action that merges quick ability activation with the player’s own skill. It falls short in some elements, such as no end game content and a loot grind that is too focused on the shop rather than rewards through contracts, and could do with a better diverse set of abilities and weapons for each character. Still, this is a game that is easy to jump into, and even if the end game does not exist, taking the game as an experience from the first to the last contract is good enough to recommend, think of it as an isometric shooter rather than an action RPG. One thing though is that make sure you have yourself a friendly bounty hunter or three to come along with you to get the best experience from this entertaining, blaster action game.                            
68	                                Procedurally generated and varied maps do wonders in keeping what is, at its core, a simple and unchanging gameplay loop feeling fresh, albeit samey. Taking down bosses feels like an achievement, and the difficulty is well balanced. The few online contracts I took showed that the classes complement each other well.                            
60	                                Killsquad is a game that mixes a lot of genres and tries to be a lot of things together. It succeeds only partially due to a limited depth and an uninspired art direction.                            
60	                                Killsquad feels like a game that’s taking a long time to cook. As much as I enjoyed my time playing it, it didn't always hold my attention, lacking a certain special quality. While it's already come on leaps and bounds, I hope Killsquad continues to improve with time.                            
90	                                If you are a turn-based RPG fan looking for a new experience that brings fresh twists on classic elements of the genre, I cannot recommend Astria Ascending enough, just so long as you don’t need an overly engaging plot to pull you along.                            
90	                                Astria Ascending holds modern JRPGs to a new standard. The sprites and environments are beautifully hand-drawn and the characters are rich with nuance and passion. But where the game really shines is its incredibly deep combat and progression system that will have you excitedly strategizing between dungeons. Some small technical issues do hold it back from being perfect, however, the issues pale in comparison to the majority of the game.                            
85	                                While parts of it felt long and grindy, the English cast is abysmal, and the dungeons design themselves left more to be desired,  Astria Ascending is still a solid entry in the JRPG genre. It does what it sets out to do and at its price point it does it pretty well. While it may not quite rise to the heights of some of the forebears it tries to evoke from Square Enix’s past, its friendlier price point makes it a great entry that can steal away 25-30 hours of time. Just don’t expect it to sway you over if you don’t already like the genre. As its tendency to get grindy, and its overwrought characters may not change your mind.                            
80	                                If one is able to put these narrative issues aside, Astria Ascending is a solid and beautiful J-inspired RPG with some noticeable (but ultimately minor) flaws. JRPG fans looking for a new world to sink dozens of hours into need look no further.                            
80	                                Astria Ascending is a game that reminds the golden era of JRPGs, with a modern twist tied to a brilliant combat system and a renewed job system. It is a must have for turn-based combat lovers.                            
80	                                Astria Ascending is filled with countless features and mechanics to add more flavor to an adventure that can last dozens of hours. However, it does have some noticeable issues that can sour the experience. The poor narrative and progression can become too tedious, and some characters will feel useless down the line.                            
80	                                It feels like a throwback to the PlayStation era in the best way, when there were always new JRPGs showing up in the hopes of getting the same sort of cult reception as Final Fantasy VII, always new titles to try out and new stories to experience, some of them winding up a bit generic but others turning into unexpected little gems along the way. Astria Ascending feels like one of those gems, except it’s a new game right now and benefits from all the hindsight that implies. If you love JRPGs, give this one a good shot. You’ll be glad you did.                            
76	                                Ultimately, Astria Ascending is as flawed as it is fascinating. It has its moments, but the story is uneven, the dialogue is rough, and the combat is fine, but it doesn’t do enough to stand out in a crowded genre. It hurts to say that, as at some points, the story feels like one that needs to be heard, and there are some parts that I won’t soon forget. As the satellite falls to Earth, it mostly burns up on re-entry, but there is a painful beauty to it all while it lasts.                            
75	                                Astria Ascending is a good JRPG, but in a year packed with lengthy games and a few issues with voices and grinding it's not that easy to recommend.                            
75	                                Astria Ascending is a competent old-school JRPG with a satisfying combat system and some fun platforming exploration, but not a very compelling story or cast.                            
70	                                The beautiful graphics, unique characters and fun combat doesn’t take away from the fact that this is an old-school RPG at heart with new school wrappings. AA boasts a fun take on the traditional job systems found in JRPGs, I just wish it was given a story to match all of the great things it has going for it. Fights can drag on at times much like the JRPG’s of old, what helps is the amazing art and effects from the various attacks. But while fans of the older Final Fantasy’s and even Dragon Quest games may enjoy this trip of nostalgia; those folks raised on Persona 5’s and the last few Final Fantasy’s might be in for a bit of a shock. Astria Ascending isn’t a bad game, just a flawed one; but if you enjoy Vanillaware games and don’t mind a grind a lot of fun can be had here.                            
70	                                Astria Ascending is a gorgeous JRPG with wonderful world-building that overwhelms the player with characters and progression systems. With somewhat standard-feeling combat that is overly punishing at the default difficulty, I felt at a loss as far as what to concentrate on to improve my party. Astria Ascending tells a beautiful story, but too often that story is buried behind too many mechanics and systems.                            
70	                                Astria Ascending had me invested in the 25 hours it took me to get to the final dungeon. However, that comes with a padded runtime of level grinding, lengthy battles, dungeon navigation confusion, and many menu interactions. So if you begin, prepare not to understand what is going on until 10 hours into the game, but if you don’t have that time, don’t bother. However, those who do get far enough are in for a genuinely fun JPRG experience that only requires a few quality-of-life improvements.                            
65	                                Thanks to the beauty of its graphics and music, Astria Ascending has an undeniable charm. Far from being content to be a beautiful postcard, the title does not forget to offer solid RPG mechanics to offer a tough challenge to fans of the genre. Unfortunately, its overly classic course and ergonomic concerns make the adventure at times laborious, at least to detract from the enjoyment of the player. Nonetheless, it remains a nice title which, behind its flaws, has an atmosphere that will delight those nostalgic for old-fashioned J-RPGs.                             
63	                                Astria Ascending tries to convey the "feel-good" atmosphere of the classic JRPGs with an aesthetically pleasing art direction and promises of pure turn-based combat extravaganza. Unfortunately, its ambition falls flat due to forgettable writing and an unbalanced combat system.                            
60	                                Astria Ascending attracts you with its art, keeps you interested with its combat, but may lose you entirely due to its bland story full of annoying difficulty spikes.                            
60	                                Despite some the JRPG royalty involved, Astria Ascending just isn’t able to live up to the high expectations. The good news is that Artisan Studio seem committed to updating the game over time, so ideally the rough edges present will get smoothed out. But at the moment, Astria Ascending’s innovative combat, gorgeous art, and esoteric story are overshadowed by frustrating cutscenes, painful pacing, and many half-baked mechanics. Hitoshi Sakimoto’s soundtrack sets a high bar, but in its current state, the rest of Astria Ascending has trouble rising to meet it.                            
60	                                Astria Ascending reshapes the assets of Zodiac: Orcanon Odyssey and its fascinating art style. It revitalizes its world with a new storyline, written by Kazushige Nojima. What we have is a fun but extremely classic fantasy JRPG, which adds nothing to the genre and with obvious imperfections.                            
50	                                Overall, Astria Ascending feels like a missed opportunity. Despite these issues, the game does right by its art direction and world-building, but the fundamental gameplay drags the whole experience down towards mundanity. Having to wait for the seven enemies in front of you to status lock you to death isn’t challenging and engaging combat; it’s tedious. Jumping through dungeons hoping to find a doorway that leads to the next area isn’t interesting trial-and-error exploration; it’s dreadful. In the JRPG marketplace that’s filled with all sorts of storytelling quirks and eccentricities, tedium is simply no longer acceptable.                             
50	                                Astria Ascending wants to be so many things, and perhaps that’s part of the problem. Instead of trying to be mature or recognizable, it should focus on its unique qualities and develop them into something interesting. Whatever the case, it’s difficult to recommend Astria Ascending. There are dozens of other RPGs to give your time and money to, but if you’re curious about this one anyway, I’d strongly suggest waiting for a sale.                            
40	                                With so many other incredible JRPGs released in 2021, it’s hard to recommend Astria Ascending. It does have a very pretty artstyle, which is what will draw most players initially. The battle system and customization options can be enjoyable to tinker around with, but the lackluster story and unpleasant cast of characters really bog down the whole experience.                            
100	                                There is no doubt that The Caligula Effect 2 is a niche within a niche, and the fact that the second game so closely follows the first just confirms that the developers are comfortable with that. While it might not click with everyone, it's worth trying, because if you do like your games a bit thoughtful and arty, then this is going to be one of the highlights of the year.                            
95	                                The Caligula Effect 2 is an incredibly modern game that encroaches on territory like no other JRPG. With a stunning soundtrack and an extremely fun battle system, it’s a riot to play.  But it also has a cast ingrained into the narrative that leaves a very strong impression, and I really feel they’ll stick with me for a while.                            
90	                                The Caligula Effect 2 isn’t a sequel I ever saw coming: a follow-up to one of the most overlooked, underrated games of the last few years. It follows closely in its predecessor’s footsteps, and while it could never hope to be quite as groundbreaking, it still finds ways to bring a fresh perspective to the moral philosophy and psychological exploration at the heart of the series. It still won’t be for everyone, but nor is it trying to be—and anyone who likes JRPGs that break from the mold and leave them with something to think about is in for something special.                            
80	                                Not every sequel can surpass the original, but it’s safe to say that The Caligula Effect 2 is bigger and better than ever before. I can’t say that I was initially expecting a sequel to The Caligula Effect to even happen in the first place, but The Caligula Effect 2 is absolutely a case of something happening that I didn’t even know that I wanted—and I’m extremely glad that I was able to spend some quality time with it.                            
75	                                I haven’t had a game in which I’ve had to pull myself away from playing it for a while, but I spent a Saturday basically playing The Caligula Effect 2 and only stopping for supper. I really hope a lot of the other RPGs coming out before the year’s out on Switch can elicit that level of devotion.                            
70	                                Although the visuals may not be much to look at, the combat and story are the soul of Caligula Effect 2 that holds it all together. The music and characters are far more enjoyable than the first title, with a combat system that feels more fine-tuned and makes it flow at a better speed than the first entry. It’s harder to recommend for those who haven’t played the first as they will miss out on important references to the first, but it may be worth popping open a synopsis of the first or playing through it to get to this sequel which improves upon basically every aspect. There’s so much to love here, but the experience would be improved with amped-up visuals and more English support for some of the smaller dialogue. The Caligula Effect 2 is a unique story that touches on sensitive subjects with a lot of respect wrapped up in a wonderfully-enjoyable RPG that’s the perfect length without overstaying its welcome.                            
60	                                The story nudges this one just above being a thoroughly average RPG. It explores some interesting topics and themes that I haven’t seen many other games attempt to address. By contrast, the gameplay is so average it could have fallen out of a kit. I suppose the key thing is that it’s not bad to play, so if you have room on your plate for an RPG with bland mechanics but a good plot, you’ll want to check out The Caligula Effect 2. Just make sure you either play the first game or read up on its story and characters before you dive in.                            
60	                                Like its predecessor, The Caligula Effect 2’s greatest sin is that it is entirely average. The soundtrack is incredible, to be certain. Progress is clear, given that the dungeons work so much better. The general story feels stronger as well. But the supplemental elements, generic enemies, and need to only take advantage of the tactical parts of battle when facing bosses leave it feeling a bit lackluster. It’s fine and even has its moments, but I suspect only FuRyu fans or people who loved other games in the series will really connect with it.                            
70	                                Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl may be basic on the surface, but the exhilarating gameplay and edge of your seat action more than makes up for its lack of content by providing players with a fun platform fighter that rewards those who take the time to learn its surprisingly complex combat mechanics. I just wish online multiplayer was more active (come find me online and let’s fight! I main CatDog).                            
70	                                Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl is a complicated package. Its core combat and attention to character detail are great, but everything around that is bone dry. Playing as these lovable Nicktoons may interest some, but I didn’t want to stick around for the no-frills matches. Hopefully, Ludosity and Fair Play Labs can keep adding to Nick Brawl post-launch and flesh out what's missing while getting Nickelodeon’s full backing to make it a better product for the fans.                            
70	                                Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl offers surprisingly competent Smash-like brawler gameplay, but is severely lacking in the bells-and-whistles department. Brawling fans will likely have a great time with this one, but those looking to ease into the genre should look elsewhere.                            
70	                                Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl is full of quirky references, easter eggs and cameos of many popular Nicktoons franchises. But once you manage to see past that, it's easy to notice what a shallow and empty game this is. Sure, it can be fun at times, but the magic dies down quite easily.                             
70	                                Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl is riddled with flaws. Not very pretty, not always very precise, a little sparse in content, the dubbing of the original cartoons are absent ... However, the fighting game of Fair Play Labs exudes passion. We don't recommend it to everyone, as NASB is targeting a very specific niche. By mimicking the physics of Super Smash Bros. Melee and implementing one of its advanced techniques, this atypical brawler manages to seduce those nostalgic for the early 2000s. Those will see it as a good way to immerse themselves in the licenses of their childhood while by rediscovering familiar sensations and a solid competitive environment. Hopefully the studio's follow-up will be good, as Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl is holding something.                             
70	                                Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl feels incomplete in a lot of ways. It needed more modes, better sound design to provide some personality, a better selection of stages. If the developers take the time to fill the game out further, it could even end up being something pretty special. For now, this is still far better than a Nickelodeon fighting game has any right to be. The most important part of a fighting game is the feel, and the team at Ludosity nailed that. When I was tearing through foes with Reptar online, I had a hard time caring about what was missing. Players coming in with the right expectations will have a ton of fun, just don’t expect a game that is more than it is.                            
70	                                A game clearly made by Smash aficionados, with great gameplay based on solid and layered mechanics. It's weak when it comes to content, and nothing to write home about from a technical standpoint, but its solid netcode and good combat system are more than enough to capture a loving community of fighting game fans.                            
70	                                Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl is definitely more than just Nickelodeon Smash Bros., but you'll need to be willing to overlook some pretty substantial flaws to find the surprisingly nuanced fighter underneath the surface.                            
70	                                Ultimately, the success of Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl lies in how lively its online community is. We’ve found players easily enough so far, but who knows if they’ll stick around. It’ll be a shame if they don’t though, because this is a competent brawler. Its pleasant visuals, varied roster of beloved characters and surprisingly deep combat make it one of the better Smash-type games out there. But if there’s nobody online to play with, its offline content will quickly lose its fun.                            
70	                                Again, it’s the best Smash clone we’ve ever played – we just wish Nickelodeon had shown some confidence in it.                            
64	                                Although I was impressed by how solid its gameplay is, Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl still feels like a hollow experience that could have been elevated to new heights if it featured additional modes and a more fleshed-out presentation complete with voice acting.                            
60	                                Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl is a great Smash clone that painfully underutilizes its Nickelodeon license, to its own detriment. Lacking some of Nick’s biggest characters, franchises, and environments, absolutely no voice lines whatsoever, and all wrapped up in a rather unimpressive package, Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl is a good concept, and one of the best Smash-alikes to come along in the last 20 years. But it really needs a stronger presentation and more thorough use of its namesake license to earn a better foothold as a mainstay character brawler.                            
60	                                Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl doesn’t bring anything new to the table, instead offering a certainly competent if not hugely exciting brawler with a confusing roster of characters cynically chopped up seemingly for future monetisation and very little to actually fight for in terms of unlockables for the fans. The fundamentals are here, and the Sports modes are terrific fun, but there isn’t much else to get too excited about when the content included is this lacking.                            
60	                                A mechanically solid and fun Super Smash Bros. clone which doesn’t have the style, personality or affection for its characters to reach the heights of its inspiration.                            
50	                                Nickelodeon All-Stars is an obvious yet forgivable clone the manages to squeeze tiny sprinkles of originality in to its mix. However, the chasm left by what is missing from the game at the moment is almost irredeemable. Whilst the actual fighting mechanics of the core gameplay are well worked for competitive play, the lack of voice acting, game modes and general party utility leaves much to be desired. The general zaniness of Nickelodeon carries reasonably in the game, but certainly not enough to warrant purchase by casual players who are fans of the franchise.                            
82	                                Is Aragami 2 rough around the edges? You bet. Does it lack challenge? Unfortunately. But, that doesn't mean that it isn't a heck of a lot of fun. In fact, its arcade-style approach to stealth gameplay had me hooked and I'm looking forward to more sneaky action.                            
72	                                Aragami 2 is an adventure that can be enjoyed by stealth fans and anyone who wants to try infiltrating an enemy base with satisfying results. Even if you’re bad at stealth games, Aragami 2 encourages you to create your own path and explore different ways to tackle a challenge. Sometimes close combat is my jam, and other times I just want to avoid confrontation. The many ways to experience Aragami 2 made it feel less catered to one specific audience and more towards anyone who is interested in trying a stealth experience. While the plot isn’t all that engaging, it is satisfying in its own way.                            
70	                                Aragami 2 is a bold and aggressive take on the stealth genre, when it finds the confidence to step out of the shadows. Occasionally, however, it's a little too timid and reverts to playing it safe, cowering in the corner rather than seizing the initiative.                            
70	                                Ultimately, poor combat fails to sour the strong level and encounter design here that meshes beautifully with well-thought-out controls and plenty of mechanical variety. An impressive sequel, but perhaps lacking the purity of its predecessor.                            
70	                                Aragami 2 is a very linear stealth experience that gives too much power to the player, making it extremely easy to overcome any kind of challenge the game throws at you. Repetitive missions and buggy performance make it a hassle to play through.                             
70	                                Aragami 2 will surely scratch any itch that you’re looking for within the stealth action genre. Laying waste to unsuspecting enemies with your buddies and jumping from rooftop to rooftop provides a certain sense of satisfaction. Unfortunately, however, the other systems can’t keep up with this action, leaving the narrative, AI, and overall game loop to simply exist in hopes the play doesn’t get lost in the shadows.                            
70	                                Aragami 2 manages to offer a classic infiltration game that offers a very dynamic gameplay thanks to very fast movements. It does feel quite repetitive with dull missions and only a handful of maps to play.                             
70	                                Whilst not revolutionary, this sequels improves over the foundations of the original, with a greater, better focus on multiplayer and replayability.                            
70	                                Aragami 2 is wonderful when you're being a ninja, but one-on-one encounters are poor, and a lack of variety lets it down.                            
70	                                With its simple and nervous gameplay, Aragami 2 offers a classic infiltration experience but of formidable efficiency. Add to this the many skills available to players, and the levels can be crossed with great ease for an exhilarating sensation. Unfortunately, the title suffers alongside a lack of variety which gives the feeling of always repeating the same levels over and over despite their large size and barely different objectives. We also regret the change of artistic direction for a result less captivating than in the first part and which reveals a fairly simple technique. Nonetheless, it remains a nice and effective infiltration game that will surely gain in depth thanks to its multiplayer mode.                             
68	                                Although an intriguing atmosphere, Aragami 2 can't stand out as the first game did and some choices in level design make it feel more linear than it should.                            
65	                                Aragami 2’s persistent bugs, technical issues, and a lackluster presentation bog down what can otherwise be a fun and intricate stealth action game.                            
65	                                The appealing character designs and settings, carried over from its predecessor, have lost stylistic flare alongside repetitive missions. However, Two Feathers’ score, pretty backgrounds, and smooth sneaking are the sequel’s saving grace.                            
60	                                Feeling excellent in the hands, it’s a shame that the repetitive missions almost entirely feel like side-quests, seemingly hampered to fit the multiplayer vision. [Issue#7, p.75]                            
60	                                Aragami 2 had potential to be a great follow up to an indie classic released five years ago. Unfortunately it lacks any real challenge and feels bloated with repetitive mission types and locations. The game starts to overstay its welcome after a while, but there’s definitely fun to be had before reaching that stage if you can put up with the plenty of bugs that still need to be fixed.                            
60	                                Aragami 2 tries to add a layer of co-op action on top of its core stealth gameplay. Funny enough the stealth and combat mechanics are anything but co-op friendly.  It feels like a half-baked release, with the developers having no clear direction how to continue the first game. It has its moments in co-op, but even those are ruined by the glitches and bugs. After the first few hours it becomes a repetitive grind and there is no real motivation for anyone to finish it. Aragami 2 is a completely unworthy and unmemorable sequel.                            
60	                                Coming off the first game, the hope was that the sequel would expand upon the hardcore stealth mechanics, and it would have worked a treat with Aragami 2’s larger levels. The increase in co-op partners make for more ways to have fun, and being able to see how certain groups tackle things silently or with all-out mayhem could have given the community more to strive for. The new direction in Aragami 2 is not a bad thing at all, considering the general quality present, but perhaps giving players the option between this new style and the old would have made this sequel a more complete package worth killing for.                             
60	                                A bigger, more ambitious stealth sequel which revamps the original’s mechanics and personality but most of the changes are to the game’s detriment.                            
60	                                With a patch or two, chances are Aragami 2 will turn into a game that’s well worth a stealth fan’s time and money, especially if they like dabbling in multiplayer. Until then though, you might want to think twice before diving in. While it’s initially fun nipping around Aragami 2‘s maps thanks to traversal options such as shadow leap, and later unlockable abilities really empower you, repetition does take its toll on the experience. All the while, frequent bugs and technical issues make you wonder if you’re playing something that was ready to step into the light for all to see.                            
50	                                Aragami 2 ends up being a bit of a mixed bag as a gaming experience. On one hand, the stealth mechanics, outstanding skill tree and playground-esque level designs means that the core gameplay is a blast. On the other hand, the new combat system isn't great, repetitive mission objectives and map reuse is maddening, and the bugs certainly don't help matters. The new addition of co-op has potential to make missions more fun by working with a friend, but this is purely speculation as Screen Rant was not able to test the feature as of writing this review. Stealth fans should find enough to enjoy about Aragami 2, but be prepared for a few stumbles along the way.                            
40	                                Aragami 2 could be a good stealth game, with a good foundation of stealth gameplay and even an intriguing story, but it is plagued by constant bugs, performance issues, poor level design, pacing, rough implementation of gameplay mechanics and a visual style that only further serves to make its flaws even more evident then they already are.                            
85	                                Severed Steel assaults many of your senses and rewards your bullet dodging, slow motion ballet dancing with satisfying kills while caressing your eyes and ears with the striking visuals and soundtrack it presents to you.                            
80	                                Severed Steel will be a massive video game for a narrow group of gamers. If you love perfecting a plan and then spending as much time as needed to both car3efully and quickly execute it, you will love this experience. Running on a wall, diving through a window, all the time dodging enemy attacks, only to then slide and kill two enemies before finding a safe space is a fun time. But the game can also frustrate and annoy. The levels could be a little bigger and more varied. I like the restrictions on weapon use, but some players will hate it. But the development team at Greylock knows that the first-person shooter needs to evolve to be interesting and they have some good ideas about whether the genre should go. Even if you don’t love Severed Steel keep an eye out for what they work on next.                            
80	                                Severed Steel is a fantastic ride while it last, there is a map editor for the brave but replay value is only going to be found for those that have the need to top a leaderboard or want to record some dope slo-mo montages. Anyone looking for a supremely easy to get into action game that blends the bullet-time from Max Payne with a bombastic soundtrack pumping techno music and all the slides and dives from 80-90’s action movies…look absolutely no further than Severed Steel. For a first game Greylock has nailed it and I can’t wait to see this gem on consoles.                            
80	                                It’s all genuinely a lot of fun. I do think there’s probably a little too much challenge for some people, and the short campaign won’t keep everyone’s attention, but for those who like to look cool and seek high scores, Severed Steel is going to be as hard to resist as an arm cannon through a flimsy window.                            
80	                                With destructible environments (you can blow holes in almost everything), frenetic action, over-the-top physics and a soundtrack that rarely takes a breather, Severed Steel is an enjoyable, cathartic experience.                            
80	                                Severed Steel feels like playing the Deathloop trailer. Not the actual game, specifically the trailer. Specifically the run shoot kick montage that comes in right at the end. Slick, stylised, and never slowing down for a second, Severed Steel looks set to launch without much fanfare, but if you want a game that gives you a great time and then leaves you alone, give it a try. KILL. THEM. ALL.                             
78	                                The longevity is not the cup of tea of this game, but for at least a couple of hours Severed Steel manages to offer something new and exciting in today's FPS landscape.                            
70	                                Due to the player character’s smooth movement, Severed Steel is an exhilarating FPS experience that will make you fall in love with your own gameplay. It gets a little repetitive, though, and the Japanese localization could be better, but players who enjoy parkour FPS games or bullet-time action should be satisfied.                            
70	                                What it lacks in narrative, Severed Steel makes up for it in the gameplay department. It’s fast, it’s frenetic, it’s vibrant and by golly, is it fun. There’s no greater pleasure in somersaulting over goons to air out their brain cases in glorious voxel violence. Switch off the lateral thinking and engage those cat-like reflexes.                             
70	                                An independent first person shooter influenced by F.E.A.R. and Mirror's Edge. Frantic rhythms and bullet times in profusion for a short, intense and demanding experience, but not without some flaws.                            
60	                                Severed Steel was fun to play, but I couldn’t recommend it at its current price in its present state. Greylock Studio needs to throw some intense boss battles in there, a few tough enemies, and, in my opinion, rework the bullet time metre. I really hope the developers don’t move onto their next project straight away, and instead turn this game into a series that will make people look forward to the sequel. If you love these types of games, then there is no doubt in my mind that you will also enjoy Severed Steel.                            
80	                                WRC 10 is a safe entry, celebrating the long, rich history of the World Rally Championship, while taking care to not break anything that was already working well. If you missed out on WRC 9, you may be content with picking that up for a bargain (assuming you have a disc-based console). If you want the latest and most up-to-date rally racing simulator, though, then WRC 10 is more than competent at providing a ton of fun for rally fans everywhere.                            
80	                                WRC 10 is a treat for any rally fan. It still draws some minor flaws from itspredecessors, but it provides a player with best WRC experience to date, with a better car physics, interesting career mode and possibility of creating your own rally team.                            
80	                                Despite the visual breaks and screen tears that seem to happen oftentimes, WRC 10 is the ultimate rally game on PS5. At this point, there is no better alternative if the objective is getting the wheels dirty on the gravel roads.                             
80	                                Although the framerate has taken a step backwards, everything else is as good as, or better than, before. A rally racing experience that doesn’t disappoint. [Issue#6, p.83]                            
80	                                Although WRC 10 is not as big a step forward as WRC 9 was, it still offers a lot of improvements. The 50th anniversary mode is also a very welcomed addition and mixed with the return of many legendary drivers, the final package is more or less exactly what Rally fans would want in a game.                            
80	                                On time to celebrate the 50 years of WRC Rally, WRC 10 is extremely similar to last year's iteration, but at the same time is packed with content and has the needed tweaks and improvements to make it worth the purchase.                            
80	                                A few issues with the visuals take the shine off of WRC 10 which is otherwise yet another authentic, enjoyable rally game from KT Racing. Not a vast amount has changed since WRC 9 but what new content that has been added, including the Anniversary Mode which celebrates 30 years of the sport, does just enough to make this a worthwhile annual iteration for the series.                             
80	                                It's a big yes and a very beautiful candle blown out by Kylotonn. If it does not upset the regulars, WRC 10 manages to advance all of its game modes with small nice touches, such as tire allocation management, new career roles or the livery editor. . Anniversary Mode galvanizes content and lifespan via new, delightfully old-school layouts, to make the title the most complete in the license. We take real pleasure in terms of racing sensations and a total change of scenery on some specials, despite the recurring lack of staging and some technical flaws (tearing, cliping ...). But that is not the important thing: WRC 10 ends a decade at the top of the slope masterfully climbed by Kylotonn in recent seasons, and we hope that the French studio will succeed in closing its commitment to the world rally championship in the best possible way next season.                             
80	                                Kylotonn continues to improve with WRC 10 FIA World Rally Championship. It remains a great drive and the career mode, whilst a little stagnant, does offer you plenty to get on with. The anniversary content feels like a well-rounded mode that, although steep in difficulty, allows you to enjoy the series' more iconic vehicles. The DualSense is put to good use and it's nice to hear your co-driver has some more personality this time around. It's not taking large strides but remains a fantastic rally experience.                            
80	                                Still the best rally game out there, with some impressive content and excellent dualsense compatibility on PS5. The career mode is simple but efficient and the 50th anniversary content is great for veteran players looking for some difficulty aimed at the long term fans of the license. Let's hope for some new gen engine for the next entry.                            
80	                                It's hard to avoid comparisons between WRC 10 and the increasingly liberal depiction of rallying in the DIRT and Forza Horizon series, but where they've veered off in a new direction, WRC 10 remains faithful to its source material and offers a fine emulation of the World Rally Championship with a few technical niggles.                            
80	                                WRC 10 is a great rally package that hones many of the WRC 9's strengths to a finer edge. There’s a couple of visual glitches that need working on, but all in all, rally fans will love what KT Racing have put together this year.                             
80	                                WRC 10 builds on the success of its predecessor with another impressive rally sim. The handling feels excellent on the track, and speeding through all the official routes is a real thrill. Alongside its meaty Career mode is a long list of ways to play, including the 50th Anniversary cars and events, which are a great addition. It's not perfect, lacking some visual polish and locking content in unusual ways, but overall, this is another step in the right direction for KT Racing.                            
80	                                Bringing back all of the modes from last year’s WRC 9, including the unique co-driver mode, while adding a new Anniversary Mode and some welcome new features, WRC 10 is the biggest entry in the series yet. It can be punishing at times, perhaps overly so, but it’s hard not to be impressed by the game’s authenticity. Racing through stages is always exhilarating, thanks largely to the impressive visuals and reliable physics model. And whether you want to sink your teeth into a meaty career or dive in for a quick challenge, there’s a mode for you. There’s still a little room for improvement, but WRC 10 is undoubtedly the best rally game you can buy right now.                            
80	                                WRC 10 is another solid entry in the long-running series. This year’s a special one for WRC fans thanks to the 50th-anniversary content which is its own game mode. The racing is as good as ever and the Career mode has taken pains to bring fans into the backroom of the sport. A few performance issues aside, WRC 10 is a must-play for rally fans.                            
78	                                WRC 10 is substantially identical to WRC 9, with the same technical issues. The only important add-on is represented by 50° anniversary mode, that pays homage to some of the most iconic rally races.                            
77	                                WRC 10 is a solid entry into the franchise. While there are usually updates, pretty landscapes, and nods to the parts and history of the sport that’s about all that’s new. It feels like last year’s edition, but just with some more polish and finesse. That’s fine, but I’m just not sure if it’s worth taking your keys and trading them in for the newer model. It is a fine ride and time, but overall nothing special to take for a spin.                            
77	                                WRC 10 isn’t going to be for everybody, but I think the ones that love it will really love it. The driving is excellent, and the sound design is next to none. Plus, it features a deep career mode and several historical scenarios for you to sink your teeth into. One minute, it’s frustrating the hell out of you; the next, you’re pumping your fist in the air over the milliseconds you were able to shave off a run. And that’s what racing is all about.                            
75	                                The franchise doesn’t make the hoped-for leap in quality, it just takes a step in the right direction: this will hardly be enough to satisfy the most demanding drivers or those who already own WRC 9, but several off-road enthusiasts may still consider it more than enough to have fun.                            
62	                                Even with a decent amount of recycling there is enough content, neat track design and mostly a decent driving experience. But with the apalling technical problems the motivation keeps grinding to a halt over and over.                             
60	                                WRC 10 FIA World Rally Championship is the full name of the game. Quite a mouthful for the official video game of the royal class in rallying, already the tenth in the series. WRC 10 builds on the solid foundation of its predecessors, and that results in a very enjoyable racing game.                            
60	                                WRC 10 is a fun and packed experience. If you're a newcomer, you'll need patience. In your early hours, you’ll feel overwhelmed by the game’s lack of aid, and you’ll definitely need to check a YouTube tutorial or two to get going. It’s a more hardcore experience, that's for sure, but even then, its campaign mode pulls you too far away from the central experience. However, once you begin to familiarize yourself with the racer, it offers up an addictive and brutal experience that’ll have you memorizing corners like never before. And there is something here for even those who often dabble in more casual racing games.                             
80	                                Neptunia x Senran Kagura: Ninja Wars is the hyper-specific and ultra-niche crossover game I never thought I'd get. It's a delight to see the Senran Kagura crew after so long, and it's a blast to see the Neptunia girls in what is easily the most fun and satisfying to play spinoff in the series. The lack of extra features and watered down story leave something to be desired, but if this is the first of many games, then it's a promising new direction for both series.                             
80	                                 Working with a clearly limited budget, Tamsoft has focused on delivering a tight action-combat system, while also relying on the fan service of both Senran Kagura and Hyperdimension Neptunia to see it through. It’s a good couple of hours of genuine fun, with the requisite bath scenes, humour and familiar characters to meet and fight. You can’t help but think that both properties could have grown to become more than this, but taking as it is, it’s still entertaining nonsense, with a heavy emphasis on the “entertaining”. I play enough serious games that require deep analysis, this kind of thing is my ideal break time between them.                            
75	                                Neptunia X Senran Kagura: Ninja Wars is a delightful crossover boasting an engaging narrative, heartwarming character interactions, and a steller localization. With its added mechanics, this is by far the best Neptunia spinoff, but that doesn’t absolve it of tedious and repetitive progression. It’s evident this is a game for the fans of these busty fighters, but we could have used additional characters and modes to heighten the experience.                            
73	                                No matter how you slice it, Neptunia x SENRAN KAGURA: Ninja Wars is a great deal of fun, especially with its hilarious dialogue scenes and cheeky cast of characters. It could have been a lot more enjoyable with some sort of multiplayer component, though.                            
70	                                Neptunia hits a real middle-of-the-road balance with this one. On one side, the combat falls short of frantic ninja battles and the graphics desperately need a touch-up. On the other side though, the character designs are some of the best I’ve seen for a spin-off, it’s a treat to see the Senran Kagura gang interact with our favorite CPUs, and the story brings along the same meta humor and gaming references that Neptunia rarely fails to deliver. While the uninitiated might not find it fleshed out enough, for those who are fans of both series in this crossover, Neptunia x Senran Kagura: Ninja Wars is a beautiful bacchanalia of busty, battling babes.                            
65	                                Neptunia X Senran Kagura: Ninja Wars will appeal to longtime fans of either series, but outside of that it’s an average action-oriented JRPG plus visual novel that anyone can easily get the hang of. There’s plenty of titillating fanservice to go around, even if Sony insists on at least some of it being censored for the Western release. It’s a safe bet if you can’t get enough of Neptunia and the rest of the Goddesses or Asuka and the other shinobi, but otherwise there are more traditional games that are probably a better use of your time.                            
65	                                Neptunia x Senran Kagura Ninja Wars maintains the cheeky charms of both franchise, bringing in the fun, safe jokes and jabs at the gaming industry. However, it taxes that charm with the gameplay choices made at the end of the game. There's enough here to bring in longtime fans, and even some crossover fans between the franchises, but not many others will rally to this mashup.                            
60	                                The visual novel portions are good and offer a change in pace, but feature limited animation and come off as low-rent as a result. That holds true for the similar texture work in a lot of environments, which doesn’t do justice to the impressive character models used and the solid animation across the board. For fans of either franchise, there’s a good amount of content here to enjoy, but this isn’t the kind of game that is likely to make new fans of either series on its own.                            
60	                                For fans of the Neptunia and/or Senran Kagura series, there’s a fair bit to like about Neptunia x Senran Kagura: Ninja Wars. While I couldn’t muster any enthusiasm for the game’s story, others may get on better with it. And while the combat isn’t great, it is at least enjoyable for the most part, with some pretty challenging boss battles. Add in plenty of fan-service that some are sure to appreciate as well as post-game content, and you have a game that will keep those who gel with it entertained for many hours. Those unfamiliar with either property involved in this crossover, however, probably won’t find anything other than confusion and disappointment.                            
50	                                If you like big-breasted anime females then Neptunia x Senran Kagura: Ninja Wars has got you covered. With lacklustre story, shallow hack-and-slash mechanics and ancient graphical presentation, there’s little here worth your time. If you’re a fan of action or RPG games that are anything more deep than a puddle, Ninja Wars ain’t gonna be the one, basically, especially if you don’t fancy balancing barely-glad animated women on peaches.                            
45	                                Neptunia x Senran Kagura: Ninja Wars is full of fanservice and anime girls with big boobs, but not much more. Insanely long visual novel talk segments, and the story is so silly there’s not much motivation to keep playing.                            
100	                                For anyone new or returning to the Pokémon series, Brilliant Diamond & Shining Pearl is a perfect starting point that bridges the gap between classic and modern Pokémon games. The quality-of-life additions make the game more accessible without making it feel bloated, the art style is simplistic and cute, and the gameplay mechanics will keep players moving through the adventure with ease. For veterans of the series, these versions are an easy recommendation and an excellent recreation of a fan favorite. With only a few exclusive Pokémon between Brilliant Diamond & Shining Pearl, either one is an excellent choice for any player.                            
90	                                It’s been a long time since players have gotten to revisit Sinnoh, and all things considered this may be the definitive way to enjoy it. While some changes may seem minor, they really do add to the overall enjoyment experience. Sinnoh was always fun but flawed, and while that’s still a teensy bit true here, it’s better than ever before. Although it’s easy to say it’s a shame that it’s missing the Platinum content, what’s here is still fantastic and will make it more fun to replay for years to come. Sinnoh fans will hopefully be excited to see their region well taken care of while they were gone, and new players can easily enjoy it without having to pick up old systems and cartridges that are now significantly more expensive. Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl are the best remakes we’ve gotten since Heart Gold and Soul Silver and offer up a fantastic, faithful yet slightly re-imagined version of Sinnoh to enjoy before the next entry in the series makes its debut.                            
90	                                I've had an absolute blast with Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl, and I know there's plenty more for me to see thanks to their sheer size. With changes that lean mostly toward quality of life improvements, this is a firm reminder that Pokémon games can be extraordinary and one of the most enjoyable remakes I've played in a long time.                             
90	                                Pokemon Brilliant Diamond is like a warm hug, offering nothing but smiles and enjoyment throughout. Long term fans will find the quality of life changes make it even easier, but nonetheless, it's an otherwise faithful remake and a joy from start to finish.                            
88	                                From a certain point of view, Pokémon Brilliant Diamond is a remake that doesn't like to take too many risks, improving on the original experience without making any major changes. Yet this is also its greatest strength, especially for those who never played the original chapters on DS. The result is an authentic recreation of a historical title, polished and cleaned up from outdated game design elements.                            
86	                                Quotation forthcoming.                            
85	                                Overall, Pokemon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl are a must-play. Despite the chibi-style graphics feeling wacky in places, the gameplay overall is fantastic. The changes to the Grand Underground are incredible, offering up a wider selection of Pokemon early on, and Exp. Share really isn’t an issue. Even if you played the original games, BDSP offers many new features to the point where it feels like a new experience. And we won’t spoil it, but the post-game is something all veteran fans will absolutely love, especially if you like battles…and Platinum.                            
85	                                While it feels like Game Freak have been trying to find their footing with Pokémon over the last few years, Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl are a confident showing by ILCA that proves the series is far from dead. The classic formula is unchanged here, and still holds up, which will no doubt please long-time fans and newcomers alike. Smart new additions that feel like natural additions to the base game, coupled with a visual overhaul that captures the feel of the originals make for an experience that’s as nostalgic and comforting, as it is fresh and reinvigorating for the franchise.                             
85	                                Taken on its own, without the history of the franchise and the desire to see it be more, Pokémon Brilliant Diamond is a great RPG. There's a wide variety of content, the gameplay is fun and polished, and the presentation of the remake is charming and warm. While it's easier to recommend to newer Pokémon fans than those who played the Nintendo DS originals, taking another trip around a much more visually striking Sinnoh region turned out to be more satisfying than I anticipated. I'm certainly not in a hurry to leave it any time soon; that's for sure. However, with Pokémon Legends on the horizon, this one-two punch of Pokémon titles could be a winning way to close out one year and welcome in another, with a blast from the past followed by something we haven't really seen before. That's a Jigglepuff double-slap I can get behind.                            
85	                                Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl are the best way to enjoy the fourth generation. Coming back to Sinnoh after so many years feels amazing because of the new art style and the charismatic characters that inhabit the region. Also, the new features are very welcome for a better experience. These remakes are a must for any Pokémon fan who wants to feel nostalgic while also being great for new players.                            
85	                                While Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl don’t move the needle in terms of what Pokémon games will look and play like moving forward, they mostly hit the mark in being faithful to the originals. I’ve really enjoyed my time re-exploring Sinnoh, despite my qualms with the lack of critical path difficulty. They’re a welcome throwback to a simpler time when I felt completing a Pokédex was a somewhat realistic task to undertake. Veteran trainers will find plenty here to scratch a nostalgic itch, and new trainers who missed out the first time around have a solid adventure to embark on.                            
84	                                Players of the DS original might mostly experience the same game. But including some new cool features, its well modernized graphics and raised accessibility, this Pokémon RPG will be a joy to play as well for fans as for gamers of every age, who can get out just a little of the franchise.                            
80	                                Whether you’re a Pokémon fan who fondly remembers the original or a newcomer looking for a way in to the series, Pokémon Brilliant Diamond is easy to recommend. It may seem a little bit costly for a remake that stays fairly close to the source material aside from a snazzy new look, but there’s still a lot of game here. Even better, it’s enjoyable no matter your age, gender or skill level. Once you’ve started playing Pokémon Brilliant Diamond you really will feel the urge to catch ’em all. And the improvements here mean it’s never been as easy or enjoyable.                            
80	                                I believe going with the route established by the Let's Go games would have been better, but that doesn't mean that Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl aren't excellent entries in the Pokemon franchise, and games that Pokemon fans would enjoy playing - old and new alike.                            
80	                                In spite of a lot of missteps and unforced, unnecessary errors, however, Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl are great outings.                            
80	                                Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl are incredibly faithful remakes of Diamond and Pearl, warts and all. There are some nice new additions that enhance the experience, and the visual style is unique and quite good-looking. It’s hard not to recommend these to any Pokémon fan or newcomer to the franchise. There might be a few negatives, but none of them take much away from the overall excellent experience.                            
80	                                If a good remake is defined by its loyalty to the original, then Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl are very good remakes indeed. They are Diamond and Pearl down to nearly every detail, looking nicer than ever before with a few small tweaks, most of which are pretty good ones. It leaves in some of the original’s roster flaws, but they’re largely forgivable if you’re like me and have some degree of nostalgia for a time when Pokémon’s scope was smaller. And yet, I can’t help but be disappointed that Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl weren’t braver in how they improved upon the originals in the same way other Pokémon remakes were, bringing even some now-historic improvements back to correct history’s mistakes. Of course, I still had a perfectly pleasant time revisiting both Sinnoh and the simultaneously simpler yet more challenging era of Pokémon that took place within it reminded me of a time when this series asked a bit more of us.                            
80	                                Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl take me back to a simpler time in Pokémon where Mega Evolutions, Z-Moves, and Dynamaxing didn’t exist. It’s a wonderful reminder of how far Pokémon has come and it feels like a love letter to arguably the most formative generation of Pokémon.                            
80	                                Pokemon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl are good remakes of an inherently flawed Pokemon game. The games lean a little hard into recapturing the experience of the originals, which is a detriment and somewhat negates the fantastic visual and quality-of-life improvements. Honestly, it feels that Pokemon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl are a preemptive olive branch to Pokemon fans ahead of Pokemon Legends: Arceus, in that it provides a decidedly retro experience as an alternative option to what is sure to be the most envelope-pushing Pokemon game made since the franchise launched 25 years ago. Pokemon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl are made for those looking to celebrate the past of the Pokemon experience. For the rest of us, it's a nice distraction to hold us over until the launch of the next Pokemon game in a couple of months.                             
80	                                Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Pokémon Shining Pearl are faithful recreations of the classic DS titles, updated with plenty of small, ease-of-life changes. While some fans might feel alienated by the features that have been added to make the game easier, the changes are a net positive that make the game a smoother experience all-round. The upgraded Underground and Super Contest Show are both more involved and offer more things to do, and the remade music tracks sound beautiful. Although a lot more could have been done to make these remakes truly special, what's here will make Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl a worthwhile experience for returning fans and new ones alike.                            
80	                                The original DS Diamond and Pearl were great back in the day, and 15 years later this new coat of paint makes them just as entertaining. The improvements may not be as drastic as some may have hoped, but what's here is a solid Pokémon adventure regardless.                            
80	                                Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl are bordering on a masterclass of how to do faithful remakes of a classic and beloved series. They're nostalgic, charming, lovely experiences that perfectly mix the old with the new to present a journey that will appeal to fans of the originals while still keeping things fresh and up-to-date. As one half of a pair of Sinnoh games, they deliver on their half in spades, and show that The Pokémon Company is ready, willing, and able to mess with the formula for the sake of the series. I have my complaints here and there, too, but overall, these are the Diamond and Pearl remakes that I didn't know I wanted until I fell in love with them.                            
78	                                Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl are not the best games of the series nor the bravest, but they strongly respect the original games and the ones who played them, and they do everything they can to show that.                            
78	                                Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl offer exactly what you expect, sometimes a bit disappointing, but still oh so nice.                             
77	                                Two fairly correct remakes that will especially appeal to those who did not know the originals. On the contrary, veterans may be missing more news and, in particular, the changes introduced by Pokémon Platinum.                             
76	                                Unique remakes of their kind, which find all their strengths and weaknesses in the morbid attachment to the past.                             
75	                                Quotation forthcoming.                            
75	                                For fans, these throwbacks aren’t to be missed, but if you’re looking for a reason to see what Pokefuss is all about, you’ll find better avenues into the franchise than these remakes.                            
75	                                Despite everything, it's impossible to shy away from your pleasure when it comes to beating the League (not that easy, by the way) and watching your Pokémon evolve. A return to Sinnoh that could be improved, but very pleasant.                             
75	                                Whether you like the new "chibi" art direction of the Pokémon Diamond and Pearl remakes or not, you have to admit that a lot of fans will be happy to see the Gen 4 back on Nintendo Switch. Despite a lack of real new features and some flaws in the graphics, it's a real treat to be able to play again this iconic game with good tech on the Switch. Especially since (re)discovering Sinnoh is a great way to remember the area and better enjoy the return to the past with Legends Arceus.                            
74	                                Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl prove two things: that the original was a game loaded with charisma and that makes you come to the end of the remake looking forward to it, and that without the improvements and additions that the developers keep adding, however small and unambitious we may think they are, the house of cards falls down on us.                            
73	                                Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Pokémon Shining Pearl are a worthy return to Sinnoh, respectful remakes that seek to offer exactly the same experience as the original Nintendo DS works; albeit with new conveniences that help the pace of the adventure while borrowing quality-of-life details already established in the series. On the other hand, they are also much more permissive releases, with facilities during the adventure that cannot be turned off and that help too much in once-challenging situations. They are very conformist titles. The return of the random encounters did not convince us, especially after seeing how well the ability to see creatures in the environment worked. With plenty of content thanks to the Grand Underground and a generous endgame, it will provide plenty of hours of gameplay even though they are limited to the first four Pokémon generations. All of this, coupled with a beautiful art style despite being low-key on a graphical level, makes for an unmissable trip to Sinnoh for fans; especially those planning to play Pokémon Legends Arceus in a couple of months.                             
72	                                On the flip side, I'm not sure who this release is for. If you've never played Diamond and Pearl, you'll probably love these games. Assuming you don't mind a couple of tiny steps backwards in terms of mechanics. If you're familiar with the old games, this will be a mostly pleasant nostalgia trip. Especially if you've forgotten everything that happens, like me. The only hitch is the baffling visual and audio design. More than anything, these choices suggest that the Pokemon Company isn't exactly sure what fans want out of these games. Brilliant Pearl feels well-crafted yet confused, like they pursued several disparate visions at once. If you can see past these strange decisions, you'll find a set of pretty respectable Pokemon games.                            
70	                                Pokemon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl have their flaws and are not particularly ambitious remakes, but they’re somehow still fun. I don’t regret the 25 hours I spent with the main story of Brilliant Diamond, and there is enough post-game content to keep me interested for a while longer. I just can’t help but wish that these gems shined just a little bit more brilliantly.                            
70	                                Pokemon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl keep enough classic elements to feel like a comfy nostalgia trip, while smoothing over enough of the rough edges that they feel relatively contemporary with other recent Pokemon games. It can't be easy for a storied franchise to pay homage to its legacy while also modernizing in this way, but Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl strike the right balance. It's the classic Pokemon you remember, without most of the little annoyances you've forgotten.                            
70	                                Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl is a fun adventure, and the Grand Underground is bound to keep you busy. However, it fails to reach the heights of Pokémon Platinum, with a limited Pokédex that excludes several great Pokémon unnecessarily.                            
70	                                Pokemon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl show that not all remakes are worth playing if you have the originals on hand.                            
70	                                Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl play it safe, faithfully remaking two classic DS games -- at times to a fault.                            
70	                                Quotation forthcoming.                            
70	                                If you’re looking for a nostalgia-fuelled blast of classic Pokémon, Brilliant Diamond & Shining Pearl are as good as it gets. It's the classic 2006 DS adventure through and through, freshened up with a slick coat of paint and some much-needed quality-of-life upgrades. As someone who sank hundreds of hours into those original games, part of me is thrilled. The other part, unfortunately, can’t shake the feeling that the long-awaited gen-four remakes could’ve been considerably more than a pretty basic reheating of 15-year-old games.                             
70	                                There are some much-needed quality of life improvements, and the games are well polished and run really smoothly on the Switch. It’s hard to see newer fans finding much to appreciate here, but those that have fond memories of the original Diamond and Pearl will have a lot to love about Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl.                            
70	                                Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl lead us to rediscover the fascinating Sinnoh region fourteen years after the original. Too bad that many of the improvements introduced by the Platinum version have been removed and that these remakes do not present any substantial upgrade, except for a renewed visual aspect.                            
70	                                The problem is that these are very good remakes of Diamond & Pearl and excellent games in and of themselves - they’re just nowhere near the best Gen 4 remake. Given that Platinum is still superior to Brilliant Diamond & Shining Pearl in almost every conceivable way, it’s difficult to comprehend why these games even exist aside from making them available on a modern console, in which case… just port Platinum. That’s the main takeaway I have from my time with Shining Pearl: it’s brilliant and it shines, but not quite as brilliantly bright as a game that came out 13 years ago.                            
68	                                Long-time Pokemon fans that don't mind the repetitive nature of these games will have a lot to look forward to here. Pokemon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl is by no means a bad Pokemon game. It's competently developed, but some of the decisions made prevent this entry in the franchise from standing out. The lack of changes from the original titles further bogs down this otherwise solid addition.                            
65	                                If you haven’t experienced Pokemon Diamond or Pearl yet and don’t have access to Platinum, then the Gen 4 remakes on Switch might be worth exploring. Sinnoh has its own charm to it, and completionists will likely enjoy the endgame that is Grand Underground collecting. I just hope that when the time comes to remake Black and White, whatever team handles it is a lot less conservative.                            
65	                                Everything genuinely good about this game exists mostly because the original Diamond and Pearl games had a good story and interesting characters. This game takes all those and rehashes it only through the veil of basic 3D characters that have the mobility of Funko Pops. Boring textures and an almost purposeful lack of detail takes something that was originally served as a masterful dish and converts it into a repackaged microwaved TV dinner.                            
65	                                What we have here is a very similar, yet different, version of Pokémon Diamond and Pearl in high definition on Switch, but it’s not definitively the best version to play today, as was the case with FireRed/LeafGreen, HeartGold/SoulSilver and Alpha Sapphire/Omega Ruby when they launched. While it’s not a stunningly brilliant or shining remake, it is a very faithful one that plays it safe and is a welcome return to Sinnoh for those with fond memories of visiting on the DS — but I’m more excited to see what’s new in the region with Pokémon Legends Arceus.                            
60	                                Brilliant Diamond lacks ambition and will frustrate fans of Pokémon Platinum more than it pleases. Still, an extremely faithful classic Pokémon remake might be just what we need before Game Freak wildly changes up the formula with 2022’s Pokémon Legends: Arceus.                            
60	                                Pokémon Brilliant Diamond is a surprise. Despite some teething issues, it came through as a decent if uninspired showing for fans of fourth-generation Pokémon games, and an enjoyable return to the Sinnoh region. Some issues could’ve been ironed out better, but for old players and new, this is probably the ideal way to experience Pokémon Diamond and Pearl.                            
60	                                Despite the fresh coat of paint they feel stuck in the past, rolled off the factory line with seemingly little question as to why they’re doing it...Pokémon fans and newbies alike will love Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl because Diamond and Pearl were great. But there’s not enough brilliance or shine here to add the lustre they deserved.                            
60	                                A cheap-looking and unambitious remake of a generic Pokémon entry that seemed bereft of new ideas in 2006, let alone now.                            
60	                                While some of the slower elements of the original games have been fixed, and The Grand Underground makes up for the comparatively weak Pokédex, Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl’s new art style and a few other stumbles make this pair of games a somewhat disappointing retread of Generation 4. They’re also very clearly in the shadow of Pokemon Legends: Arceus, the upcoming open-world-like Pokemon game that has fans hoping it can take the series in exciting new directions beyond 20-year-old mechanics. If the remit of these remakes was to remain faithful to the original Gen 4 pair, we wish they’d also stuck to the pixel-art aesthetic. Aside from The Grand Underground – and the connectivity with the current games in the series – there’s very little reason to play Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl over your original DS copies.                            
91	                                Riders Republic dropped in at the busiest time of year. There are many games vying for gamers’ attention at the moment, and I think the full price, AAA price tag could cause some people to bail. Overall I’ve had a blast during my time in the Republic. It has an insane amount of content and replayability, and I think most people could easily rack up enough playtime where they felt like they got their money’s worth. There are a few issues, like the awkward trick controls, but none of them get in the way of the pure fun I had while playing this thrilling extreme sports bonanza. Book your tickets, but don’t bother buying round trip because once you get a taste of the Republic you won’t want to leave.                            
90	                                Riders Republic is a fantastic open world sports game that delivers big on massively multiplayer arcade mayhem whilst also giving solo players a ton of content to dig into. There's an enormous, breathtakingly beautiful world to explore here that delivers carefully curated tracks and events for each every one of its sports disciplines, whilst also giving you free reign to head on out and cut your own path through its seven national parks' worth of wonderful wilderness. Yes there's some painful dialogue here and there, as well some issues with bugs and crashes during this launch period, but none of that is enough to put us off getting stuck in and just enjoying the smorgasbord of arcade sports action that Ubisoft Annecy has served up.                            
85	                                Extreme sports, massive multiplayer tests and a huge open world, full of adrenaline-pumping and exciting activities, you will find in a game that explores fresh and fun ideas, without more.                             
85	                                Then there’s just simply the atmosphere. This game is absolutely gorgeous. The levels are based on seven real locations in the Southwestern United States, each with faithfully recreated topography and landmarks. The game is filled with landmarks to find and read flavor text about. It has totally inspired me to visit some of these locations someday, hopefully before they’re gone, whether due to climate change or just the course of nature, as the game heeds on several occasions. You can play the game in Zen mode to explore unperturbed or really get lost traveling slowly from location to location between events and just enjoy the environment ad nauseam. I highly recommend it.                            
83	                                Riders Republic is the dream come true for the extreme sports fans and a delightful experience for those who are looking for a fast paced sports game with tons of things to do.                            
80	                                The game crashed on the Xbox Series X semi-frequently, but I pressed on, knowing that right around the corner I was likely to find some new thing that would surprise and delight me.                            
80	                                Riders Republic is a game with an annoying attitude, an alarming number of different sports and an overwhelming world map. Despite that, the game impress with great controls, varied challenges and a world filled with fun activities. In addition, the fact that we are not spoiled with well-made ski, snowboard and bike games, makes Riders Republic a more than welcome addition to the genre.                            
80	                                Riders Republic has all the annoying elements of a modern game that wants to keep the player constantly in their game, so they can spend more money. At least, it’s doing it with a very good gameplay, improved in all the aspects that went wrong with Steep.                            
80	                                Riders Republic offers a cornucopia of extreme sporting choices for players to choose from. By giving enough attention and fine-tuning to each individual sport, it has created an evergreen title to receive future updates or expansions to build upon well into the future. With a solid foundation offering solo and group players fun and exciting experiences, Riders Republic has set the stage incredibly well. While its predecessor Steep failed to capture a lasting audience, I feel strongly that Riders stands a much greater chance at retaining players’ interest due in part to its tongue-in-cheek tone combined with the game’s sheer variety of extreme sports adventures and energetic open world. I look forward to returning to Riders Republic to bike down mountain paths or fly through narrow canyon gaps while listening to alt-rock radio sometime soon.                            
80	                                Riders Republic on Xbox takes the basic framework of Steep and adds a whole load more to it to create a very fun arcade sports title. The skiing and snowboarding events feel like the SSX games in their heyday, the rocketsuit and wingsuit events are exhilarating, and the bike events ensure you are constantly one wrong move from total disaster.                            
80	                                Riders Republic is a solid sports game, graphically satisfying and with all the right cards to give you many hours of fun thanks to an accessible control system, many customization options and a wide variety of events. It's not perfect and it will need some updates, but it's undoubtedly the best extreme sports game available today.                            
80	                                Riders Republic is a hell of a good time, a freeform open-world sports game that encourages you to follow your passion and find your own fun.                            
80	                                Riders Republic is an excellent, arcadey extreme sports sandbox with bonkers multiplayer events, an impressive open world, and unfortunate server issues.                            
80	                                A definite improvement over Steep, thanks to the Mass Races and the new bike discipline, but Ubisoft Annecy has still got a lot of work to do if it wants to break into upper echelons of gaming. It should look to Playground Games and how they craft an elite open-world sports game if they want to reach that next-level, then maybe they too could be mentioned in the same breath as SSX Tricky. Fingers crossed, the potential is definitely there!                            
80	                                Ubisoft's second effort into mountain and extreme sports is an obvious hit. Leveraging the tech of modern platforms makes Riders Republic a fast-moving, always exciting open world, but it also makes room for those who just want to soak up the scenes of life from the mountaintop. While the audio tracks may have you reaching for the mute button, it's maybe a better experience with your own custom soundtrack free of the super-dorks roaming the cutscenes anyway. In a year where Ubisoft's sandboxes were seeming stale, Riders Republic manages to keep me chasing down every icon like I rarely do anymore.                            
80	                                I suspect Riders Republic might be something very special indeed. We’ll have to wait and see what the community does with it, but early signs look promising. There’s a rock-solid foundation to build upon, and such a wide range of events to take on that each set a high bar in terms of what could come next. It does feel a little directionless at present. There's simply so much on offer that it's difficult to find focus within the noise. This direction and focus will likely be shaped by the community in the coming months, as user-created content takes over from the events on show at launch...Whether you want to race on a bike, fly through rings with a rocket strapped to your back, or simply explore the gorgeous natural views, Riders Republic has you covered. If you can handle the incessant hipster speak, that is.                            
78	                                Owing to its precise gameplay and satisfying open-world, Riders Republic has the makings of an extreme sport fan's dream. It just would have been nice if the title's exhausting and obnoxious attitude had been checked at the door.                            
75	                                To conclude, Riders Republic is clearly a good game that will certainly delight gamers who love thrills and extreme sports. We'll put aside the aspect of microtransactions in a game sold at a high price which darkens the picture a bit, because it remains a very good game experience. Technically, the game is not as good as Forza Horizon, even if it is strongly inspired by it in its gameplay structure, but the map is simply brilliant, large and full of surprises for the ingenious players who like exploration. A very good end of year surprise to be consumed without moderation, but while wearing a helmet.                            
75	                                If Riders Republic may disappoint Steep fans (the title goes against the spirit of the game of 2016), this new production remains a must for all thrill seekers. With its many playable sports disciplines, starting with the bike which offers exhilarating sensations, its exotic world and its many modes available both solo and online, the latest production from Ubisoft Annecy will undoubtedly keep you busy for the long haul.                             
70	                                Riders Republic is the game designed for all lovers of extreme sports, orphans of a product capable of satisfying their desire for adrenaline. The new Ubisoft title, net of some technical problems, is the new meeting place for fans of tricks and thrilling races.                            
70	                                Riders Republic isn't called Steep 2 because of new gameplay functionnalities and its added little bit of craziness, but at its core it really is just a sequel, without much innovation. Still fun to play though, if you find your own pace through the repetitiveness.                            
70	                                Riders Republic is a fun game that offers a wide range of exhilarating and unique activities that mostly benefit from its 'always online' gameplay model, but also suffers from a few shortcomings. The world feels alive, the Events are a blast and the game looks gorgeous. However, some aspects of the game are a little lacking at launch, namely the multiplayer modes, customisation and air sports.                            
60	                                Riders Republic’s failures in effectively catering for newcomers - despite its excellent range of accessibility features - are clear for me as a newbie. But anyone experienced with this genre will have a bloody fantastic time here, and it's well worth picking up if you’re into it.                            
80	                                Probably wait for a decent sale… but certainly worth a look if you enjoyed the original GTA (or the sequel).                            
80	                                If Rustler suffers from anything, it’s just that it sometimes doesn’t quite know what it’s trying to be. Most of the time, it seems to be specifically trying to parody GTA, and it plays a just like the early top-down games from said series. The tone is a bit off-beat, though, with all the jokes, pop culture, and poking of fun. It might not be perfectly cohesive, but whether you’re here for the jokes or because you like games where you can be on the wrong side of the law, there is definitely something here for you. So if you aren’t easily offended by the copious amounts of cursing, blood, and violence, you should definitely give Rustler a go. Pull that guard off his horse, ride off, and don’t look back!                            
78	                                Rustler finally arrives on PCs and consoles. If you are passionate and remember with joy the very first GTAs and have a heart close to the atmosphere and genius of groups like Monty Python, Rustler is right what it does for you.                            
70	                                Rustler isn’t shy about its homage to the classic Grand Theft Auto games, as it puts on its persona as a goofy, medieval Grand Theft Auto imitator with unabashed glee.                            
68	                                Rustler is a fun pastime without particular pretensions that succeeds discreetly, and at a low cost (on Steam it is in promotion for only 14 euros), in order to entertain the player with a series of characters and events beyond all logic.                            
68	                                Sense of humor is personal and what you respond to is none of my business. Rustler might very well be your comedy jam, mixing GTA with wannabe Monty Python and firing the joke cannon at every opportunity in the hopes that the humor will hit with someone. What we can agree on is that mechanics and gameplay are at least as important as the setting and story, and this is where Rustler fails to deliver a consistently fun experience.                            
65	                                Classic GTA gameplay in a medieval setting, coarse humour with countlesspop culture references and a horrible save system.                            
60	                                The “medieval Slavic GTA” (inspired by the early GTA games, mind you, not the 3D ones) is crude but also fun, unpretentious and full of positive energy. Chock-full of jokes, easter eggs and pop culture references, Rustler is never serious. If you enjoy such titles and are willing to accept the game’s intentionally old-fashioned formula, you could consider giving it a chance. [11/2021, p.70]                            
60	                                Grand Theft Horse is the best way to describe the game since it is created as a tribute to old GTA games. Unlike the original games, this one is a pure parody set in medieval times, where you play as a small-time thug in a crazy open-world action game, full of pop-culture references. If you can ignore some minor and repetitive bugs, and you want to experience early GTA styled game that is set in the Medieval times, Rustler is worth a shot.                            
60	                                If you want to experience a "what if" of an early GTA styled game that is set in Medieval times, Rustler is your only choice. Be warned though, the crude humor and the problematic controls might not be ideal for everyone.                            
60	                                With its widespread irreverence and punchy visuals, the work of the Polish studio does not leave you indifferent. Soaked in pop-culture references, the game - which is translated into French - will appeal to any regular in the genre, but it arrives with its bundle of bugs and suffers from a bit too repetitive structure. Fortunately, its original universe and its pace make it possible to mitigate its shortcomings and one would almost come to hope for a more successful sequel. Because as it is, it is better not to be too picky to fully appreciate it.                             
50	                                Rustler is a game that does a little of both but doesn’t commit to either idea enough to make an interesting experience. This indecision to commit hampers the game’s enjoyability and leaves players with a confused understanding of what the game wants to be. This compounded by a lack of black representation while directly referencing black culture everywhere, makes this game difficult to recommend.                            
50	                                Rustler copies ideas and mechanics of Grand Theft Auto 2 and tries desperately to squeeze them into a medieval setting. Neither the story nor the gameplay are exciting. Even the Monty Python-inspired Quests do not make it a good game and the highest of feelings was us smirking about the silly humour.                             
80	                                While the Just Dance series reek of a yearly subscription based model, it still is a lot of fun, especially with the bops released in the year to date. Can't beat dancing to your hearts content with your friends and family in this wholesome and colorful game.                            
80	                                Just Dance 2022 is a dance without a revolution, but what a dance, ladies and gentlemen. Strengthened by a sensational line-up that ranges from the old glories of the past to the new stars of the present (even virtual ones), the last chapter of the series focuses on the quality of the selected pieces and on choreographies of indisputable specific weight. The various levels of difficulty ensure an experience within everyone's reach.                            
80	                                Just Dance 2022 offers us again hours and hours of dancing with new songs and visual effects that join the songs that Ubisoft has already included in previous games. However, as you may have noticed, the news in relation to game mechanics and modes are practically non-existent.                            
80	                                There’s no doubt that Just Dance 2022 has fallen into some of the traps of other annual games by not making it feel like a total makeover, but once you feel the quality of the choreography and see the improved visuals, you can’t deny that Ubisoft is still trying to deliver an exceptional product where it counts: the dancing and song selection. Even as one who is slightly out of touch with current hits, most of them successfully motivate me to get off my butt and start dancing.                            
80	                                Just Dance 2022 comes back with a variety of interesting tracks and manages to entertain everyone.                            
78	                                A nice 2022 iteration with few new features and a very good selection of songs.                            
75	                                Just Dance 2022 is here: are you ready to dance again with friends?                            
70	                                Just Dance 2022 has worked really hard to add several fun choreographies and a rich and varied song selection: these efforts will certainly be appreciated by the long-time fans of the series.                            
67	                                Just Dance 2022 comes to the Nintendo Switch with new game modes and improvements to its graphics and sound quality. Unfortunately, it does not add anything new to its already well-known formula. To make matters worse, its track selection will feel too limited if you do not plan on paying for the Just Dance Unlimited subscription.                            
60	                                The modern dance visuals and the addition of popular songs in Just Dance 2022 will likely appeal to longtime fans of the game; however, those who are new to the series may want to opt for a version a few years older, and purchase the Just Dance Unlimited subscription instead, to save money and learn gameplay with songs that have easier dance moves. While unlikely at this time, the option to permanently purchase past songs as DLC would be a big benefit for Just Dance 2022, allowing players to pay a one-time fee for their favorite songs, rather than a monthly steep monthly cost for songs that may not get played.                            
60	                                Make no mistake. Just Dance 2022 is Just Dance 2021 (and 2020, and 2019) all over again. Also, make no mistake, this remains tons of fun. Sure, nothing has really changed, but if it ain't broke, why fix it. Sadly, while there has been a pretty strong improvement on the visual front, with the people behind this experimenting way more with the videos and the choreography, the soundtrack is one of the least impressive in the franchise.                            
60	                                Just Dance 2022 is okay. It's more of the same with some cool new tracks, a slick and smooth experience overall that plays it safe and works just fine as a result. However, it also constantly pushes its subscription service and ends up feeling a little convoluted and tacky as it spends more time flogging tracks you don't own over letting you enjoy the ones included with the base game. Fans of the series — or anyone who's just danced to even a single track from the series — will know exactly what they're getting here, but newcomers should be aware that they'll need to fork out more cash after buying the game in order to enjoy the full experience.                            
85	                                Back 4 Blood is a great game when played with other people, truly evoking the spirit of Left 4 Dead for a new generation of gamers. This time there’s the incentive of a progression system to keep players coming back, although the Corruption Cards don’t always make those repeated playthroughs as unique as they should. For those wanting to play on their own, it would be best to wait until the game has been patched to include single player progress. Hopefully that shouldn’t be too much longer.                            
85	                                Without a doubt, Back 4 Dead is all about the co-op gameplay and mixed with the newly introduced card system. If you combine the two, killing those ugly creatures is extremely fun, though be warned, it’s also extremely challenging as well. On the other hand, if you’re not the biggest fan of co-op multiplayer and would rather stick with the solo mode, this isn’t as exciting as it should be. Though, as I said, even the co-op multiplayer has a bad side, as the overall experience depends on your team and their way of playing the game.                            
85	                                Back 4 Blood is a wonderful call-back to the games that have come before it. And even though it’s not a direct sequel to Left 4 Dead 2, it brings back the most important elements of the series. But it shouldn’t be seen as only a spiritual successor because it adds so many new features that make it an extremely satisfying modern-day FPS. While a few elements impede the gameplay, they can be easily overlooked when you have a great team to play with.                            
82	                                Back 4 Blood is the successor made and a perfect evolution of what Left 4 Dead in its day. It is true that it does not revolutionize, but it does improve its formula                            
82	                                Anyone who loved "Left 4 Dead" and can accept that special zombies in co-op mode are not controlled by other online players will have a lot of fun with "Back 4 Blood". Difficulty spikes, the lack of a split-screen mode and problems with the bot AI do however lower our overall impression.                            
80	                                The main game is a beautifully balanced blast of team-shooter perfection. Who needs a story when the action is this good? It’s only let down by unnecessary PvP. [Issue#8, p.82]                            
80	                                Turtle Rock Studios has once again created a fantastic co-op shooter with Back 4 Blood. The game is good when playing solo, but amazing when playing with three friends. The gameplay, characters, and card system make the game dynamic and create another dimension for us to enjoy. These things are so great, making the cookie-cutter story and the repetitiveness of the environments just a bit more painful and unfortunately, these elements hold the game back.                            
80	                                Having the same gameplay core as its spiritual parents (Left for Dead), Back 4 Blood implements some new tricks to keep the player hooked. Light RPG elements, through weapon customization and deck building, enrich the basic formula of the game, providing a much needed modern approach.                            
80	                                Turtle Rock Studios have built a solid game, though it is teetering on a house of cards. If they take the wrong direction with the Corruption upgrades in the future in a bid to monetize the experience via add-ons or DLC, the L4D creators could shoot themselves in the foot when it comes to replayability. Ignoring any card concerns though, Back 4 Blood delivers a rip-roaring party-mode atmosphere and well and truly scratches that long-standing Left 4 Dead itch 12 years later.                            
80	                                Back 4 Blood successfully continues what started by Left 4 Dead, and even though there some bumps here and there in the road, everything that matters for a game in this genre is done the right way.                            
80	                                Back 4 Blood lacks the personality and charisma of the Left 4 Dead franchise, but at the same time, it also introduces some quality of life changes that make this game blast to play with friends. However, playing alone feels unrewarding because of the lack of progression.                            
80	                                Having spent a lot of time with Back 4 Blood, we think it's well worth your time and, crucially, your money. It's just a lot of fun blowing Ridden heads off or smashing them with a baseball bat like a watermelon in an anime beach episode. It doesn't really deliver a compelling experience solo – the bots are just a touch too stupid for that – but Back 4 Blood ought to become a multiplayer fixture for the rest of the generation to come. Unless they bring out Back 4 Blood 2 in, like, a year.                            
80	                                Back 4 Blood is a fun spiritual successor to the Left 4 Dead franchise. It’s entertaining, graphically well-done and offers a lot of customization for all kinds of players. While the game will get old for some, others will find ours of entertainment cleaning things up with their friends.                            
80	                                Back 4 Blood is not just a new coat of paint. It tries new ideas to shake up its legendary formula, mashing together their learning to create a cohesive, insanely fun co-op experience.                            
80	                                While it never forges its own identity, or escapes the shadow of Left 4 Dead, Back 4 Blood provides a great cover act, that captures all of the original series’ magic.                            
80	                                Back 4 Blood stands as a new standard in co-op shooters. With vibrant, intricate level design, solid gunplay, and intense moments brought on by a variety of dizzying enemy types balanced through a deep card system, it stands as a great achievement. The difficulty wall is annoying and other in game choices feel odd, to say the least, but that doesn't stop you from having an absolute blast, especially playing with friends.                            
80	                                Back 4 Blood manages to live up to its predecessors, offering an improved, deeper, funnier and more addictive experience.                            
80	                                We're back to the old cooperative mode of busting zombies like there is no tomorrow with Back 4 Blood, the heir to Left 4 Dead that keeps the essence of the franchise alive and incorporates new mechanics, but with lessons to be learned in the field of PvP.                            
79	                                Back 4 Blood is one that I’ll be playing for a long time to come. Turtle Rock Studios has committed to improving the game, both through new content and patches. And I trust that they’ll right most of the wrongs with their latest zombie-slaying simulator. It may feel light on content, and you’ll need a team of people if you want to make any actual progress, but hop on board now, and you still be pleasantly surprised at just how fun Back 4 Blood can be.                            
75	                                Back 4 Blood offers fun co-op action with a somewhat bumpy start and not always successful balancing.                            
75	                                A diamond in the rough, though one that's definitely worth playing in co-op. When you're on your own, however, the lacklustre AI and the inability to progress through the game will definitely put a damper on things...                             
75	                                Back 4 Blood is indeed the worthy heir of the first two Left 4 Dead games. There is no doubt about that. The title from Turtle Rock Studios offers nervous and impacting gameplay that knows how to reinvent itself as the players progress thanks to this successful deck system and these varied objectives that take place in many different places. Unfortunately, the production still lacks balancing. The game is either too simple or too punitive. We hope that a future update will correct all this.                             
70	                                B4B has so much potential and if it does end up getting the classic versus mode so many L4D fans want so badly then it will end up being a near-perfect game. For the time being, it’s a solid bit of zombie slaying fun that’s a cut above some of the other undead shooting gallery games out there. I just hope Turtle Rock gets the message and brings classic versus mode back from the grave, because the current incarnation of PvP is dead on arrival.                            
70	                                The campaign is Back 4 Blood's main draw, but you really need a group of friends to enjoy it to its fullest. As a spiritual successor to Left 4 Dead, it ticks almost all of the right boxes. The modern additions add to the game's variety and ensure that each run is unique, while the moment-to-moment gunplay is intense and incredibly gratifying. The overwhelming frequency of the special infected, and their disappointing blandness, is a downer, and the lack of some quality-of-life features makes playing with strangers more frustrating than it should be, especially when you're penalized for playing alone. The landscape of cooperative shooters has changed a lot in the past 12 years and Back 4 Blood might not live up to the heights of Left 4 Dead at its peak. Nevertheless, Turtle Rock's return to the genre it created is still excellent fun, provided you have others to share in the zombie-bashing.                            
70	                                Back 4 Blood is brilliant, co-op fun, with an interesting card system, but it's marred by terrible bots, awkward solo campaign choices, and a lackluster PvP mode.                            
70	                                Back 4 Blood delivers the joy of zombie slaying in small bursts, but can become a slog the more prolonged the play session. This is blood you’ll want to return for because it’s fun to slay zombies with friends, just don’t stay too long.                            
70	                                If you have a squad of like-minded buddies ready to lose many an evening to slaying some zombie infested hordes, Back 4 Blood will provide you plenty to satisfy that urge. It doesn’t quite capture the greatness of its forebears and it stumbles over itself with its erratic difficulty curve and repetitive nature, but Back 4 Blood has immensely satisfying, if simplistic, gameplay mechanic. This is a veteran, war-torn survivor who’s maybe danced this bloody dance once too many times, but it knows damn well how to deliver that co-op fun.                            
60	                                With like-minded cleaners and a weekend spare, Back 4 Blood is a hoot. Lacklustre modes and a lack of identity dampen its long-term appeal.                             
90	                                Overall, Aragami 2 is definitely my favourite multiplayer experience of the year. It’s a contender for my game of the year, too! It’s well designed, looks great, plays very well and is absolutely huge with tons of replay value! I highly recommend it.                            
80	                                With improved traversal, map design, and an option for multiplayer, Aragami 2 stands tall as a stealth title that brings the genre’s strengths to the forefront.                            
80	                                Aragami 2 is a great sequel from a gameplay standpoint, but it lacks the freshness of the original.                            
78	                                Aragami 2, in addition to some of its minor flaws, has covered all the shortcomings of the first game and got a great sequel game.                            
75	                                With Aragami 2, the development team changes artistic direction, replenishes the gameplay with everything that has been released in recent years and add content to content, preferring quantity to quality. With a little more care and a better finish, Aragami 2 could have been a jewel: as it is, it remains an effective product, but still leaves a little bitterness in the mouth.                             
75	                                Aragami 2 is another enjoyable sneak ‘em up and a solid improvement over its predecessor, but an overfamiliar world and mechanics make it hard to get too excited about the game. Aragami 2 gets the job done cleanly and efficiently, and is worth a shot if you’re into old-school stealth, but its memory may quickly fade into the shadowy recesses of your mind.                            
70	                                Aragami 2 is a huge departure from the original game. In exchanging the linear narrative-driven stealth experience for an open-ended co-op mission adventure, Lince Works has created a game that feels just as flawed as the original, but has a lot more charm in it's small moments and simplicity. Repetitive missions and enemies make it hard to get engrossed with the game for long periods of time, but as a stealth action game to hop into for quick little bursts, Aragami 2 can be pretty fun.                             
70	                                Even if I know that my relationship with stealth titles is kind of 'toxic', Aragami 2 is but one more symptom of that link: I know that it has flaws, but I cannot avoid ignoring them in pursuit of their benefits. In the end, any criticism about its plot, its design or its technology succumbs to the simple but fundamental fact that it is satisfying and fun, leaving behind an experience that, without a doubt, I will fondly remember and recommend to any fan of the genre.                            
70	                                For all my complaints, Aragami 2 does pull off making you feel like a ninja rather well. Planning just the perfect route to ambush everyone one by one or slip in and out without disturbing anyone felt really satisfying. It manages to tread that fine line of letting you get away with more than is realistic while still making a perfect run challenging that makes a great stealth game. I just can’t help but feel they took a few gambles with changing things up from the original, and took a step backwards as a result.                            
70	                                With its simple and nervous gameplay, Aragami 2 offers a classic infiltration experience but of formidable efficiency. Add to this the many skills available to players, and the levels can be crossed with great ease for an exhilarating sensation. Unfortunately, the title suffers alongside a lack of variety which gives the feeling of always repeating the same levels over and over despite their large size and barely different objectives. We also regret the change of artistic direction for a result less captivating than in the first part and which reveals a fairly simple technique. Nonetheless, it remains a nice and effective infiltration game that will surely gain in depth thanks to its multiplayer mode.                             
70	                                Bottom line: Aragami 2 is a fun stealth-action game armed with an abundant variety of ninja killing skills and tools which are sure to please fans of the genre, especially in co-op. However, the monotonous missions, low-production quality cutscenes, and slightly clunky combat system may cause a modicum of annoyance for some.                            
60	                                Aragami 2 has its good moments, its old-fashioned take on stealth games occasionally is fun, but ultimately, the taste it leaves is that it's a mediocre game. To its credit, Lince Works decided not to take the easy route of simply improving on cons of the first Aragami and promote it as a sequel, but the result doesn't fully justify that decision.                            
60	                                I do truly wish I could call this a diamond in the rough or some classic in the making, but that’s just not the case. Aragami 2 is fine and while I am likely to revisit it one day, I wouldn’t say you need to rush out and play it right now.                             
60	                                Aragami 2 has lots of potential but falls into repetition, some odd story choices, and frustrating online play.                            
60	                                While there’s intrigue to discover amongst the structure and layout of locales in Aragami 2, the sequel’s turn away from the distilled charm of its one-man stealth prior leaves more perplexed questions than convincing answers.                            
59	                                A disappointing sequel that sacrifices stealth mechanics in favour oftedious co-op missions.                            
55	                                Aragami 2 might be appealing to some stealth fans, but the final package ultimately fails to meet the current standards of the video games industry.                            
55	                                Padded, mediocre, and tripped up by horribly dated AI and unreliable game mechanics, Aragami 2 is the kind of stealth game that you may want to just sneak past.                            
50	                                While Aragami 2’s serpentine levels are fun to stealth around in, especially in co-op, a needlessly drawn-out campaign rife with frustrating combat and game-ending glitches prevent it from becoming a tale worthy of song.                             
40	                                Aragami 2 is so ridiculously easy that you can breathe in its general direction and you’ve exploited some gameplay mechanic. It’s great for those who like speedrunning, or those who might not have a lot of time in their day, but if you’re hoping for the slow and methodical stealth gameplay of Aragami 1 then you won’t find it in the sequel. Just like most developers (eyeing you Ubisoft over Splinter Cell) it seems working gameplay formulas mean bugger all.                            
85	                                If you are nostalgic for the gaming scene of the 90s, The Big Con is a can’t-miss throwback. But even if you are maybe a little younger, or sick of wallowing in that most radical of eras, you may find a lot to like. It’s certainly a very cool con artist story, which is appealing to me. Funny and a little melancholy, The Big Con is exactly the sort of adventure game I’ve been wanting to play for decades.                            
85	                                The Big Con is a welcome nod to one of the coolest decades of all time, featuring some great writing, beautiful visuals, and fun gameplay.                            
85	                                The Big Con is a bright, fun and surprisingly wholesome crime spree through a Saturday morning cartoon version of 90s America. You might develop a compulsion for kleptomania, you might feel bad for picking hundreds of pockets, but at least you'll laugh along the way and feel cool doing it.                            
83	                                This is a great narrative adventure inspired by the 90s, with funny, well-written dialogues and a very unique art style.                            
80	                                The Big Con is a heart-warming coming of age story that will delight 90s kids, referential-humor enjoyers, and those with sticky fingers. Its relatable protagonist never loses her heart of gold, despite the horrible circumstances she finds herself in, which serves as a shining testament to the dev team’s ability to carefully craft a story using controversial mechanics. If you have $14.99 and 7 – 10 hours to spare, take a look at The Big Con — it’s bound to steal your heart.                            
80	                                Despite some technical glitches, The Big Con succeeds in telling a moving story with plenty of wit and charm. The aesthetics and humour are spot-on, each character brings a new dimension, and this is a world worth getting lost in. If you’re looking for a healthy dose of ‘90s nostalgia and a throwaway attitude to petty crime – give it a go. I swear I’m not having you on. This time.                            
80	                                You’ll only need several hours to complete it, but The Big Con’s one adventure worth looking into. Offering a vibrant presentation brimming with nostalgia, there’s an enjoyable story about 90’s America which kept me hooked. Though the pickpocketing mechanic lacks depth, that’s made up for by a fun narrative and good sense of humour, keeping the action entertaining. If you like indies, The Big Con’s a breath of fresh air that comes recommended.                            
80	                                The Big Con delivers a heartwarming story set in an iconic time period filled with beautiful characters and stunning environments.                            
70	                                The Big Con is ultimately about its story, though, and it's a story that mostly works despite an inescapable sense of familiarity. There aren't many beats here that you haven't seen before, and while that lends the closing hours the feeling that expected pieces are simply falling into place, the game has enough verve and style that it manages to hold it together. The writing isn't especially funny or clever, but there's enough personality in the art style and story conceit that I was still entertained for the bulk of the six hours that I spent with it.                            
70	                                The Big Con succeeds when, as its title suggests, you’re working on elaborate con jobs that provide clever puzzle ideas with a lot of open and fun gameplay. While the rest of it is fine, it never feels like the sort of epic cross-country adventure it should be, despite what its stakes would suggest. It still makes for a good adventure with well-done challenges, and that alone may be worth it, but don’t expect a grand score by the end.                            
70	                                The Big Con is a charming little slice of nineties nostalgia. It's propelled by its strong writing and world-building, a deep understanding of the era it is referencing, and some fantastic characters, and it's certainly a road trip players will enjoy taking. Although its gameplay is limited and there are some technical issues, it's an earnest and compelling journey.                            
70	                                Even if it does get monotonous sometimes, I certainly can't fault the originality of the pickpocketing idea. The Big Con is not the kind of adventure game I see every day and credit to Mighty Yell for trying something different. I don't know if it's because I was hoping more would be done with the idea or because the game felt too short, but I ultimately came out of this game wanting something more. Maybe that's just the hunger for a bigger score.                            
65	                                The Big Con is a nice game, but not very deep. It entertains for the time it lasts, but in the end it doesn't give much in terms of experience, if not for its graphic style that stands out on everything else.                            
100	                                I’ve been pretty much bowled over by Life is Strange: True Colors - the story, characters, and themes have really managed to strike a chord. Others might find the tone and writing not to their taste and that's fine, but I don't think anyone can deny that the team behind it have progressed their art form and game-making skills in a positive direction with this latest addition to the franchise. Long may it continue.                            
90	                                True Colors is everything a game in its genre should be: A well written story, with lovable characters, in a small town made from Hallmarks wet dreams. The perfect pace of the story and the social issues are just the icing on the cake.                             
90	                                Life is Strange: True Colors is a “must-play” for all those that played the first title and felt that something was missing in the second. It’s a game of landmark events, strong emotions and tough decisions. Be prepared to meet Haven Springs and unravel the secret that hides within the city and that conceals the death of so many other characters. Having the risk of becoming one more death, Alex does not give up on bringing justice and truth to all those that accompany her, including you.                            
90	                                Life is Strange: True Colors creates a world that players will want to be in, and a story that needs to be seen to the end. Despite the small scale of Haven and its unnerving issues, True Colors plausibly allows itself to have high stakes and is convincing in its premise. It's a game that is not only a shocking emotional rollercoaster, but also a compelling lesson about the importance of empathy, and an enjoyable time that could serve as a viable foundation for more storytelling in the future.                            
90	                                Life is Strange: True Colors isn't perfect, but it's exactly what fans of the franchise needed. Deck Nine has hit the mark and has taken command of the saga with a powerful story and a protagonist to remember.                             
90	                                Life Is Strange: True Colors is a return to form for the franchise, which delivers a captivating story from start to finish, one that will see you go through all the emotions. Just like Alex Chen herself.                            
86	                                Life Is Strange: True Colors automatically becomes one of the best games in the franchise. Emotions with a life of their own.                            
85	                                Life is Strange: True Colors confirms the excellent skills of Deck Nine, giving us an interesting title with very nice characters, an interesting plot and powers that dig into human emotions. It' s not a masterpiece and it doesn't reach the standards of the first LiS, but it's still a great title for those who love the series and who appreciate narrative adventures.                            
85	                                Life Is Strange: True Colors has kept me more emotionally invested in any Life Is Strange Story since I played the original. Consistent writing for both main and side characters, a compelling, well paced story as well as dialogue choices that have actual consequences over the course of the five chapters, True Colors may just be the best entry into the Life Is Strange series.                            
85	                                Life is Strange: True Colors lands itself as one of the most cathartic and emotionally resonant video games I've played in a long time.                            
80	                                With its emotional gut-punching story, memorable and wonderfully crafted characters, and a beautifully designed setting that immerses you deeply into its world, Life is Strange: True Colors is a superb entry into the Life is Strange series. While the game's conclusion does come just slightly too quickly, and some technical issues spoil the show, you won't regret experiencing Alex Chen's story. Simply put, Life is Strange: True Colors is a must-play.                            
80	                                Life is Strange: True Colors has an intriguing mystery and strong cast of characters. The implementation of the protagonist’s superpower is also the most creative than it has ever been. While the fundamental choice-based narrative structure is largely the same, the game feels fresh with unique new ideas and presentation. Fans of the series and newcomers will definitely enjoy this.                            
80	                                Life is Strange: True Colors may sadly dim towards the end, but it’s worth checking out alone just to experience Haven Springs, with its gorgeous scenery, terrific cast of characters both major and minor, and an intriguing mystery that requires quite a bit of fun gameplay.                            
77	                                A beautiful setting, convincing characters and a handful of heartwarming and heartbreaking moments make up for the inconsistent story and messy pace of True Colors. Hopefully Deck Nine continues this line, because this is the best Life Is Strange since part 1.                            
70	                                Life is Strange: True Colors is an experience that can be appreciated in the sweetness of its journey, sublimated by shimmering colors, animations more accomplished than ever and very beautiful melodies. With this episode, Deck Nine Games chose to explore empathy from top to bottom; a preponderant aspect in the powers granted, the narration and the construction of the characters. The whole provides a very neat adventure on a human level, but which undeniably lacks a certain liveliness in its actions and the unfolding of the plot. The result is an investigation that lacks a certain panache.                             
70	                                Life is Strange: True Colors is another good installment in the series. However, there are some flaws. The setting is far too small and you will find yourself visiting the same locations time after time. Next to that, there are some flaws in the story. Although the writing is good, the game loses focus once in a while and lets you LARP instead of looking for clues. Overall it's just a good popcorn game, but not more than that.                            
90	                                Thanks to the AI Director, incredible atmosphere and great pacing, Back 4 Blood is a triumphant return for Turtle Rock.                            
88	                                Back 4 Blood is an exceptional FPS that sets a new standard for co-op zombie murderfests.                            
85	                                All in all, Turtle Rock Studios’ latest effort is a solid, well-polished co-op shooter with only few blemishes, and some minor tweaking could transform it from a good game to a great one. With more content incoming and the card system offering new and fresh twists, Back 4 Blood is one I expect to be playing for a long time to come.                            
85	                                Back 4 Blood is the ultimate cooperative experience, without a doubt. It may unwisely punish solo players and lack deeper launch content to attract and immerse casual players, potentially impacting the game’s community and longevity. But its core mode of pitting four players against an unyielding mob of monstrous death brings a constantly evolving, sometimes overwhelming challenge. If it weren’t for the extensively unique and clever card system and the overly satisfying gunplay, Back 4 Blood would stumble and shamble out of the gate. Yet its core mechanics provide such a fulfilling reward, that I can’t imagine not wanting to dive back in day after day and fend off the Ridden.                            
85	                                Back 4 Blood doesn’t just imitate the Left 4 Dead formula like these titles, it elevates it past its predecessor. Perhaps it’s the nostalgia for the 12 year old title, or maybe just poor memory, that fuels our rose-tinted retrospection and distaste for something new. Regardless, Back 4 Blood takes the concept to the next level and builds in layers of cool ideas and just plain fun gameplay.                            
85	                                Back 4 Blood is a fun blend of the classic Left 4 Dead template with a reasonable inclusion of modern traits. The basic zombie shooting brings forth just as many memorable and chaotic moments as the developer's original series, and the game absolutely sings in multiplayer, but the solo experience remains engaging for those who only get along with bots. The modern touches add some depth that doesn't detract from what makes this kind of game so fun in the first place. The steps to increase replayability accomplish that without feeling forced. Despite a few minor issues here and there, Back 4 Blood is a solid debut, and those who wanted some progress in the genre are going to find it in buckets here.                            
82	                                Back 4 Blood is a great co-op driven by the roots of the genre and beyond.                            
82	                                Back 4 Blood continues the tradition of PvE shooters started by Turtle Rock Studios with Left 4 Dead, but offering a better gameplay dynamics and a fun campaign to play online with three other players.                            
80	                                You can say it's just L4D, but also so much more. It not only brings the horde style zombie shooter to its next level but also adds some nice progression options in the style of roguelike games.                            
80	                                On the whole, I really like B4B. I’d like to see the difficulty spikes addressed and some expanded PvP choices, both of which I think can and will be pretty easily added and fixed. I’m also hoping that more people start playing it, as most of the runs I’ve joined have at least one BOT in it and is often nothing but BOTs (and when I’m playing with nothing but BOTs, why do I have to wait for online server space to play it?). The BOTs are competent shooters, and use their player advantages pretty well, but have zero ability with regards to the additional level objectives – they won’t plant explosives or carry supplies, and they tend to hang near you, which is good from a survival perspective, but doesn’t help in finding weapon and healing caches. But for a team that plays well together, and I’m hoping to get my crew to move over from L4D, it’s a fine zombie run and gun.                            
80	                                Back 4 Blood truly is the Left 4 Dead 2 sequel you’ve been waiting for. While it might be more difficult than the average zombie co-op, its unpredictable gameplay will have you coming back time and time again.                            
80	                                Back 4 Blood is an immensely fun multiplayer shooter, with an astonishingly replayable cooperative campaign full of intense periods and challenges that encourage teamwork. The competitive Swarm mode may not have the refined suspense of Left 4 Dead’s Versus mode, but it does have a few satisfying moments.                            
80	                                Back 4 Blood is an action game that should be checked out with its deck building system, competitive mission structure, replayability and fun gameplay.                            
80	                                Back 4 Blood is fantastic fun - in the right circumstances. Hopefully, Turtle Rock plans on augmenting Swarm and solo mode in future updates. If you've got at least a couple of friends interested in partying up, though, taking down a few thousand Ridden for an hour or two is a no-brainer.                            
80	                                Whether I’m laughing out loud over a brilliant strategy gone awry or just barely getting onto an escape vehicle with Ridden right on my heels, Back 4 Blood has the right formula for a good few weekends of co-op fun. If it gets even more support and updates down the line, I could see this taking up a spot as a go-to social game for quite a while to come. Really, it just feels good to have this sort of game back again.                            
80	                                Back 4 Blood is a worthy successor to the Left 4 Dead franchise. It maintains the fundamentals of what made the original so addictive and satisfying while adding its own little flair with the rogue-like deck building system. What holds Back 4 Blood from getting a better score is its high price tag and lack of solo play progression.                            
80	                                Back 4 Blood isn't perfect and doesn't revolutionize zombie-themed co-op FPS, but it effectively demonstrates that, thirteen years later, the right ideas can revitalize superb but dusty gameplay.                            
80	                                Overall, Back 4 Blood is a great successor to Left 4 Dead. It definitely needs some tweaks here and there, but it’s a blast with or without friends, and the bots are pretty decent as well. Turtle Rock Studios could have just made a straight clone of L4D, but it didn’t. As the various new systems get polished and balanced, this game will likely be looked on as finely as its predecessors.                            
80	                                Back 4 Blood doesn’t nail all the twists it attempts, but a creative card-based progression system, fantastic campaign, and lighthearted tone make it a fun spin on a familiar genre.                            
80	                                Whether it’s your first time shooting zombies or you’re a Left 4 Dead veteran, Back 4 Blood is frantic action that you’ll love. Gameplay is exhilarating, every headshot feeling impactful and explosions are meaty. Running through tight corridors with your friends, Ridden rushing you down from every corner, will put anyone on edge. Although, a terrible PVP mode, weirdly paced campaign missions, neglected single player, and new card mechanics may polarise players. Regardless, Back 4 Blood is thrilling and I’m thirsty for more.                            
80	                                Back 4 Blood takes an old-school approach where it makes sense, and modernises where it doesn’t. It’s heartening to be engaged by a game purely for its gameplay and variety, and not to pad out a progress bar somewhere.                            
80	                                Back 4 Blood is an excellent co-op zombie shooter, with a card-based perk system and wonderfully satisfying gunplay building upon the fantastic foundations of the Left 4 Dead series. But if you’re planning on playing solo you may want to stay clear, with a design clearly optimised for multiplayer.                            
80	                                In spite of its shortcomings, though, Back 4 Blood is already starting to feel like it could very well become my go-to zombie shooter whenever I just want to have a fun, social experience with friends. Despite how saturated the zombie game market has become, Back 4 Blood cuts through all the noise and delivers a solid co-op shooter that oozes charm and prioritizes fun with friends over everything else.                            
80	                                Sublime co-op blasting with lashings of gore, the only downsides to Back 4 Blood come from single player. One of the best reasons to get four friends together, the game could well be an all-timer. There are problems, but nothing you’ll think about when you’re in an all out brawl.                            
80	                                The fathers of Left 4 Dead are back with a true successor for the franchise that keeps the formula pretty much intact, but adds a layer of complexity to make it deeper.                            
80	                                It can feel unbalanced and unfairly punishing at times, but when all of its systems click into place Back 4 Blood is a ton of fun.                            
80	                                From the very first moment, Back 4 Blood unmistakably shows all the signs of the heavy legacy it carries on its shoulders. By playing on the lowest difficulty, in fact, the offer is substantially in line with the Left 4 Dead canons, appropriately updated and enriched with a greater variety of play. However, when you find yourself taking up arms in the most "hardcore" modes (a physiological stage in a title like this), you cannot help but appreciate the innovations introduced in terms of progression and the merits of the Card System developed by Turtle Rock Studio, which greatly increase the tactical depth of the gameplay and the cooperative dynamics underlying the experience. Back 4 Blood is certainly not a perfect title, but overall the Californian team's proposal is effective and well thought out. It goes without saying that to fully enjoy it you will necessarily have to find suitable companions, but we can assure you that the game is worth the candle.                             
80	                                Back 4 Blood isn't Left 4 Dead, and it doesn't even try to be it, doing away with the classics' straightforward campaign in favor of a more modern experience that rewards progression and offers plenty of replayability. The excellent map and mission design, the huge variety of builds made possible by the card system, and satisfying gameplay make the game by Turtle Rock Studios the one to get for those who have a team of friends ready to take on hordes of undead, but those who are looking to play the game solo would do better to look elsewhere, as Back 4 Blood doesn't offer much for those not too keen on teamwork.                            
80	                                Despite a few shortcomings, Back 4 Blood is nevertheless an excellent and fresh take on the beloved Left 4 Dead formula.                            
80	                                Back 4 Blood is the spiritual sequel to Left 4 Dead and as such it won't disappoint those who have long been waiting for an inspired, solid and fun zombie-based cooperative experience.                            
75	                                Back 4 Blood is a solid return to the genre Turtle Rock helped define. Intense encounters and essential teamwork highlight the bonds of multiplayer, but uninspired missions leave many of the chapters feeling unmemorable. Meanwhile, the card and loot systems are easy to learn and deep enough without getting in the way. It will take more to keep players eager to return for another decade, but the foundation is a firm starting point.                            
75	                                Back 4 Blood has built on the great foundations that Left 4 Dead laid over a decade ago. The gameplay is brilliant, there’s also that little bit more to keep the challenge fresh and to keep zombie killing fun.                            
75	                                Back 4 Blood is another great multiplayer zombie game, but some serious balance issues force it to stumble out of the gate.                             
70	                                I don’t think I’ll revisit Back 4 Blood in a decades’ time the same way I do with Left 4 Dead now, but it does a good enough job at modernising the formula for better or worse.                            
70	                                Very exciting on paper, Back 4 Blood still blows hot and cold once you take it in hand. It's a good shooter, yes. The atmosphere and the Left 4 Dead touch are directly perceptible, of course. The card system extends life and encourages players to be strategic, okay. But there are still too many small imperfections here and there to consider the game a total success.                            
70	                                If the purpose of Back 4 Blood is to resurrect Left 4 Dead, then mission accomplished. I still feel that the game would have been better if it managed to differentiate itself more from its contemporaries.                            
70	                                Back4Blood is the perfect game to play with friends, if we have enough party members to make it so our team isn't filled with Bots. This title promise complex experiences, that defy the laws of physics and communication, where hope is always the last to die. In a scenario where resources are low, and the hordes are endless, the path is long until the next safe zone. In contrast, it shows some bugs that although aren't game breaking, turn the attention from which should be a gameplay focused exclusively on the mission, without any visual distraction. Still, Back 4 Blood has potential to be one of the best zombie multiplayer games of our time.                            
70	                                Back 4 Blood is a premium multiplayer game that feels quite complete at launch, a rarity in the current games market. It misses the mark with Swarm and needs an offline mode, but its core shooter mechanics and card-driven gameplay combine for an excellent evolution of the co-op formula. The depth of post-launch support it receives will rely on the success of Back 4 Blood's multiplayer offerings and that can't be presently assured, but this latest attempt easily escapes the shadow of Evolve's flop and builds on what made Left 4 Dead a classic.                            
68	                                An enjoyable co-op shooter that doesn't know what it wants to be - otherthan taking your money.                            
60	                                At every turn, Back 4 Blood frantically alludes to its superior predecessor, digging its own grave as it crumbles under the weight of blasé characters and overly complex systems.                            
60	                                With Back 4 Blood, developer Turtle Rock tries to revive Left 4 Dead's cooperative, zombie-shooting glory days. The result is a mixed bag that features solid ideas, but half-baked execution.                            
60	                                At the end of the day, this is an inferior version of Left 4 Dead 2 that lacks the style, charm, gore, and engaging characters it tries to reproduce. That said, there is a decent foundation here and there are worse ways you could spend a weekend with some buddies.                            
100	                                Sonic Colors: Ultimate is exactly what it claims to be, an Ultimate version of an already decent Sonic title. Many gamers dismissed it the first time, but if you are a Sonic fan, you owe it to yourself to check this one out. Blind Squirrel Games did an excellent job, changing what needed to be changed and leaving what worked originally intact. Super fun, challenging, and reasonably priced (even for the deluxe edition), this is a perfect title to celebrate Sonic The Hedgehog’s 30th anniversary.                            
90	                                Sega aims to please Sonic fans during the Blue Blur's 30th anniversary, trying to learn from the mistakes of Sonic games that launched this past decade and improve on them. From the enhanced graphics and extra customization, to the addition of the Tails Save mechanic, Rival Rush, and a brand new and elusive Wisp, Sonic Colors: Ultimate has proven to be the most colorful remaster in Sonic's history.It may be a rehash of a decade-old game instead of an entirely new one, but Sonic Colors: Ultimate still manages to pass the test with flying colors.                             
89	                                Sonic Colours Ultimate, the beloved return colored and brightest than ever, with improvements and a new mode called 'Rival Rush' to test your skills against Metal Sonic. Did you think Sonic Colours radiated with so much power that it was already phenomenal? SEGA has taken one step further and delivered even more hours of fun with this remaster.                            
88	                                Overall, Sonic Colors Ultimate is a must-buy for anyone who loved the original release – or who missed it and always wanted to try it out. On the PS4 and PS5, it plays wonderfully and our time netted zero issues either visually or with crashes. Some have reported issues on the Switch version and it seems like it would be best to wait for that one to get fixed-up before buying. However, if you’re playing on PlayStation and Xbox hardware, you’re in great shape to enjoy one of Sonic’s finest adventures ever and his best 3D outing in history.                            
86	                                Great Sonic games are a rare breed. At least from a gameplay perspective, it's tough to nail that balance between blistering speed and precise controls. While Colors: Ultimate never reaches that platonic ideal, it gets pretty close! Really, it's hard to ask for much more than that. Plus, the writing is snappy, the graphics are vibrant, the soundtrack is amped up, and the difficulty scales up nicely.                            
85	                                In many ways, Sonic Colors: Ultimate represents the unhindered high points of the 3D Sonic games. It's Sonic as a single playable character, so there are no werehogs, gameplay changes, or an adorable pudgy younger version of himself. It's the "run incredibly fast through loops" gameplay boiled down to its essentials, and it works really well. Even a decade out from its initial release, it's still a darn fun game, and Colors Ultimate definitely captures the feel. It won't change your mind if you never liked the 3D style of gameplay, but if you did, Colors is arguably the best of the lot. It might not have the highs of Unleashed or Generations, but it also is a far more focused affair.                            
85	                                It might sound hyperbolic because Colors is one of the better ones to trot out, but I hope this ensures that Sega stops trying to hide its Sonic history.                            
84	                                Sonic Colors Ultimate takes one of the best 3D Sonic games from the past and brings it to platforms it has never reached before, all in a fairly-priced, nicely done Ultimate package. It’s easy to recommend to any fan of Sonic games, including those like myself that never got around to playing the original in the last decade.                            
84	                                Despite being a 2-year-old game, Sonic Colors feels fresh, fun, and dynamic. The levels are colorful, interesting to navigate and fun to repeat. Control is decent, something that's more than can be said for most 3D Sonic titles. The music is energetic, upbeat and in tune with the setting of the game. The art direction corresponds to the title: bright colors and different palettes for each world. The story is simple but entertaining and does not go to the extreme of being naive or pretentious. In addition, the power-ups that the wisps give add a lot of depth to the game. Although the cinematics are poorly scaled and it has very little new content and is not revolutionary, it is a charming title worth spending a couple of afternoons. No bugs found in the PS4 version of the game.                            
80	                                Disappointing cutscenes aside, Sonic Colors Ultimate offers a solid package that finally gives modern console owners a chance to play one of the best entries in the Sonic catalog, and any hedgehog fans out there who haven’t tried it yet should track it down.                            
80	                                Let's face it: you have no excuses anymore for not playing this little gem.                            
80	                                Sonic Colors largely holds up well, and Ultimate is a great way to return or introduce yourself to what is arguably the best designed 3D Sonic game so far.                            
80	                                While it might be a hard sell for those that have already experienced the intergalactic highs of the original, Sonic Colours: Ultimate is packed with value and tweaks that make it well worth your time if you haven’t jumped into it before. It sports a simple yet entertaining narrative, great gameplay and a visual facelift that unleashes the potential of its namesake. All of this combines to further cement Sonic Colours as one of the best entries in modern Sonic.                            
80	                                Ultimate is a good remaster for one of Sonic’s best 3d adventures, that includes some nice additions like voices in new languages.                            
80	                                Despite the eleven years on his shoulders, Sonic Colors is confirmed to be among the most interesting adventures of the polygonal "second life" of the hyperkinetic hedgehog. Enjoying it fully is still possible today, certainly thanks to its intrinsic qualities - level design, in particular - but also the efforts made by Blind Squirrel in packaging Ultimate: a very good level of remastering work, albeit perfectible, and a product that we recommend without delay, especially to those who have not had the opportunity to get lost in the colors of the old edition.                             
80	                                Sonic Colors: Ultimate is a decent return to arguably one of the best 3D entries in the series. Though there are some solid visual upgrades, I was disappointed by the missed potential in having a version for the newest consoles. Besides that, refined controls, a revamped soundtrack, and some new features still make Sonic Colors: Ultimate a game that fans of the franchise will surely enjoy.                            
80	                                As a remaster, Sonic Colors: Ultimate throws in a decent amount of new stuff, but nothing beyond the frame rate and resolution bump really add up to anything that elevates the experience beyond what it was on the Wii. That said, it was already great in 2010, and still holds up as one of the best modern Sonic games to date thanks to its imaginative level designs, a laser focus on the things that make the series fun, and the addition of power granting Wisps that add a ton of variety to each level without compromising the speed that should define a Sonic game.                             
80	                                An impressive remaster of an already entertaining Sonic game, this should keep Sonic fans busy until we get something new (as long as you're happy replaying levels for S-Ranks, because otherwise it's pretty short).                            
80	                                In short, Sonic Colors Ultimate remains one of the better Sonic the Hedgehog games to appear over the last 11 years.                            
80	                                Sonic Colors: Ultimate is an exceptional port for modern day consoles. It’s one of the few great 3D Sonic games that gives hope that Sega will give the iconic Blue Blur a proper return to form.                            
80	                                Sonic Colors: Ultimate is exactly what I like to see in a Sonic game: it's fun, it's fast, and the level design is exceptional. Developer Blind Squirrel Games has also added some quality-of-life features that make it welcoming for younger fans as well. It would have been nice to see the game's cutscenes receive the same visual upgrade that the rest of the game got, but that's a minor gripe. For fans that missed out on Sonic Colors when it first released, or those looking to revisit the game, Sonic Colors: Ultimate offers one of the best experiences to ever feature the blue blur.                            
80	                                Sonic Colors Ultimate is a remastered version of one of the best 3D Sonic games released over the last fifteen years. Resolution, frame-rate and graphics are up to date and with several add-ons this game feels brilliant and very enjoyable, becoming a must have for every Sonic the Hedghehog fan.                            
80	                                Sonic Colours represents some of the blue hedgehog's finest 3D hours. As it was only released on the Wii, it deserved to be remastered for more powerful hardware. And now that it has, it's a pleasure to run through Eggman's theme park at 60 fps. Sonic Team was clearly inspired when it came up with Sonic Colours' level design and Wisp power ups. Everything still works in 2021. Sonic Colours Ultimate is the game that can be shown to those who say that Sonic and 3D don't mix.                            
79	                                A good remaster for one of the most appreciated 3D chapters of the franchise.                            
78	                                Sonic Colours: Ultimate improves on the fine game released many years ago on Wii, but after all this time it was fair to expect something more, especially for the hedgehog's 30th birthday.                            
75	                                Visually attractive remaster of the successful Sonic episode from the Wii era. Mechanically the platforming action is not as appealing as it was more than ten years ago.                             
75	                                Sometimes Sonic can end in products only suitable for its core followers, but Colours: Ultimate is a game easy to recommend to almost any platformer fan.                            
75	                                Dusting a bit of dust on Sonic Colors, Sonic Colors: Ultimate may not be the best of remasters, but it does the job well enough to spark interest in a perfectly acceptable episode.                             
71	                                Sonic Colors: Ultimate does a decent job of bringing back a good game for modern audiences. Although I have fond memories of the original, this remake made me realise that my memory can't always be trusted when it comes to how well certain games will hold up.                            
70	                                What was supposed to be a celebration of the 30 years this series has existed, turned into a bug infested glitch fest. Luckily, all of this is fixable if the team puts some effort into future updates. And it surely would be worth it, as the core game still holds as one of the most fun and imaginative 3D Sonic titles of all time.                            
70	                                Sonic Colors Ultimate is a worthy remaster of one of the blue hedgehog's best games in the last decade. It improves the impressive visual spectacle of the original, but adds little features that significantly enhance the experience. It was difficult to make a bad game out of Sonic Colors, but Sega has the merit of bringing this title to the newer generations in a competent manner, giving the fans of the series a good game starring the blue speedster - something very rare in the last few years, unfortunately.                            
70	                                It’s a mix of almost on-rails boost-based 3D sections with more classic-feeling 2D fare. The physics in the latter are still rough, with a particularly sticky-feeling jump. But Colors isn’t afraid to slow down for the occasional platform challenge. Each of the six stages in the five worlds is super-quick too, focussed on one core idea through each one. More often than not, Colors is a blast (though the meandering ending is awful). [Issue#6, p.88]                            
70	                                Sonic Colors Ultimate is the best way to enjoy the 2010 classic and remains one of the best modern Sonic games.                            
70	                                Sonic Colors: Ultimate is a rare Sonic game which is sure to appeal to existing fans and newcomers alike. Players who previously experienced it on the Wii won’t find much new here, but there’s still plenty of fun to be had in revisiting it. Sure, there’s a few flaws with the wider visual presentation and finnicky 2D sections, but Sonic Colors: Ultimate presents an entertaining package that still comes recommended.                            
70	                                Sonic Colours: Ultimate varies the traditional gameplay with new mechanics that will delight younger players. The new mechanics and a few moments make it an interesting but somewhat accessible Sonic for veterans.                            
70	                                Sonic Colors: Ultimate returns with a colorful remaster: but there are also many flaws as bad as Dr. Eggman.                            
70	                                Sonic Colors’ vibrant colors, inventive level design and fast gameplay made it a hit back in 2010. Sonic Colors: Ultimate recaptures the magic, making refinements and upgrades to the gameplay and visuals to bring them more in line with today’s standards.                            
70	                                When comparing it to other 3D Sonic titles, Sonic Colours is easily one of the better entries in the storied annals of the spiny speedster. It’s an audiovisual delight, and more often than not, calls upon the spirit of speed that made this a household name. Unfortunately, it still carries plenty of the baggage from older 3D Sonic games in terms of unnecessary difficulty spikes, and inconsistent switching between 3D and 2.5D.                            
70	                                Sonic Colors: Ultimate is a safe remaster of a cult classic which should please old players and newcomers alike, but isn’t going to redeem the iconic hedgehog’s troubled record.                            
65	                                Sonic Colors is still a great game, but Ultimate is lackluster at best. It’s glitchy, visually inconsistent, and has some abysmal mixing that makes it impossible to hear the excellent soundtrack, let alone the new remixes.                            
65	                                Sonic Colors Ultimate‘s gameplay loop is enjoyable and boasts high replayability. However, the Tails Save implementation, boss battles, and some Wisp power utilization slow this speedy adventure down to a crawl. It’s undeniably fun, but never trips up the moment you find your pace. Here’s to looking forward to new Sonic adventures in the future...Yes, that was a plea for a new Sonic Adventures.                            
65	                                For Sonic purists there’s undoubtedly a great time to be had with Sonic Colors: Ultimate. For those who are more fairweather Sonic fans or are looking for a new adventure to dive into, the game might be a little more of a challenge to enjoy.                            
60	                                When Sonic Colors: Ultimate feels like a Sonic game, it’s tremendously satisfying. When it deviates from the familiar pattern, it all feels a bit too slow and forced, shoving in too many ideas to master any of them.                            
60	                                Sonic Colours Ultimate is a solid if unremarkable retread through perhaps the only 3D Sonic game worth remastering. The visuals are just shiny enough to warrant a remaster, with a pumping soundtrack and inventive mechanics through the Wisps. Newcomers will find far more exciting and original games elsewhere, so the term ‘for the fans’ has never rung quite so true.                            
60	                                Technically it’s still the best modern Sonic, if you don’t count Sonic Mania, but time has not been particularly kind and neither has this unambitious remaster.                            
60	                                Sonic Colors: Ultimate is undoubtedly better than the abysmal Sonic Forces, a game that I was strangely compelled to play through again recently. But still, it’s far from being a great Sonic game. There are some nice new additions here, and while the cutscenes are still low quality, the in-game visuals have cleaned up very nicely indeed. It’s just the shame the gameplay is so all over the place – one minute you’ll be having the time of your life, the next, pulling your hair out in frustration. It’s tough being a Sonic fan, and Sonic Colors: Ultimate does little to ease the pain.                            
60	                                Sonic Colors: Ultimate brings new visuals and some new bits and bobs from the original release, but it lacks the punch of some other entries to the series.                            
60	                                Sonic Colors: Ultimate is the best version of an okay game. It's certainly among the hedgehog's better outings since his Genesis heyday, but it suffers from typically frustrating controls and level design. The Wisps provide variety and replay value, and the remaster adds some fun new features in addition to the visual enhancements. This 11-year-old Sonic title is one worth experiencing, but just be aware of its rough edges before you spin dash into the action.                            
60	                                Sonic Colors: Ultimate is a good game by the low standards of 3D Sonic titles. The levels are pretty and offer optional routes. The gameplay is functional but not without flaws, yet somehow still enjoyable. Despite issues, I've enjoyed my time with the game, but I doubt I'll be playing it again soon.                            
50	                                While it's always exciting for the fans to see new version of their beloved games developed with modern standards, unfortunately this is not the case for every game, and when we look back we realize that some games just don't fit the profile. The Sonic series seems to be going down that path and unless the developers inject some really cool and exciting new ideas into the franchise, titles like Sonic Colors Ultimate will be nothing more than a good old memory.                            
50	                                Sonic Colors Ultimate is a faithful remake of the 2010 game that you’ll probably enjoy if you’re either a dedicated Sonic fan or a child that doesn’t mind the easy difficulty and childish dialogue. Otherwise, there’s not much to love here, with floaty gameplay and an unengaging story.                            
50	                                Sonic Colours Ultimate serves as a sad reminder that even the 3D Sonic games that are ‘one of the good ones’ don’t hold up very well. The updated visuals, soundtrack, and gameplay tweaks at least make it a better experience than the original, and some quality of life upgrades make the worst parts marginally less painful. Sonic fans nostalgic for this game will likely still value having this remaster in their collection, but the new customisable options and Rival Rush Mode are simply not enough to make up for what Sonic Colours lacks. It’s hardly what we were hoping to get from Sonic’s 30th anniversary.                            
87	                                We'll be damned if this isn't another fine Call of Duty game. The solo campaign is excellent, multiplayer delivers on practically all fronts, and Zombies provides a neat co-op diversion. Call of Duty: Vanguard represents great value, and enough new stuff to warrant taking a look.                            
85	                                Did Call of Duty Vanguard turn me into a fan of PvP shooters, no it didn’t, but I am certainly glad I played it and am looking forward to playing some more Zombies with friends once it launches for everyone. I loved the campaign though, as well as the four operatives, and Monaghan was just terrific. The visuals, sound mixing and score were also top notch in every way.                             
80	                                So, Call of Duty: Vanguard. The campaign is great, the multiplayer is fun and Zombies will appeal to previous fans. As an overall package Vanguard is capable of providing hours of fun - all pushed along with brilliant visuals. This is a great trip back to World War II.                             
80	                                Call of Duty: Vanguard will get better with time, but the launch game is still an impressive package. The Campaign is short but sweet and the Multiplayer is a blast, though Zombies fans will likely come away disappointed. Even with Zombies failing to live up to expectations, though, Call of Duty: Vanguard still has a lot to offer fans of the franchise and is very much worth the price of admission.                            
78	                                Quotation forthcoming.                            
75	                                Call of Duty: Vanguard is a full CoD package with all the series' traditional modes, but with evident compromises made to release the game on-time. The campaign is short and not so memorable, the multiplayer has major balancing problems and several shortcomings compared to the other chapters, while the Zombie mode offers little bite. It's still a good shooter, but it lacks the punch and the breadth of content that distinguished the best episodes in the series.                            
73	                                Vanguard has one of the best campaigns of the series and a very fun multiplayer. However, a boring Zombies mode and other technical problems make it below the level of the previous ones.                            
70	                                The biggest problem is CoD: Vanguard feels like the least innovative Call of Duty in years. I think a lot of that has to do with Warzone, and the fact that developers HAVE to ensure that their game can be compatible with that battle royale. The fact that so much has to go into making sure it all works together; I just feel like it has to be hampering the developer’s creativity. In my opinion Call of Duty as a whole need to take a year off and regroup, come back with something as memorable as the original Modern Warfare was when it launched. If it’s a matter of money (and I doubt that it is) developers could lean into Warzone, they already are making a killing on all the microtransactions but just update Warzone like Epic does for Fortnite. Then after a year surprise people with something fantastic… I know this will never happen, but a man can dream.                            
70	                                Call of Duty: Vanguard unabashedly apes the style of 2019's Modern Warfare, with a multiplayer that is fun though familiar, but featuring a campaign that largely misses the mark.                            
70	                                Call of Duty: Vanguard is another solid entry in the popular franchise, but far from an excellent one. The campaign struggles in the story department, but a good base of multiplayer options and a fun, if under developed, Zombies mode help save the day.                            
70	                                It may sound like we're being a bit down on this year's Call of Duty, but it's only because we know the franchise has potential. Warzone has proved it with multiplayer and Black Ops Cold War showcased it with its campaign. We hoped this would build upon those foundations, but instead it steps back into familiar territory. It's not a bad game by any means - in fact, even at its worst it's better than most first-person shooters out there - but as the games industry evolves, it's time for Call of Duty to bring something new to the table, and this isn't it.                            
70	                                Call of Duty: Vanguard proves that the franchise has done almost everything it can do without breaking out of its shell and trying something vastly different.                            
60	                                Call of Duty: Vanguard's campaign and multiplayer are serviceable enough, but nothing exceptional for the series, while Zombies is disappointingly limited in scope and ideas.                            
60	                                Call of Duty: Vanguard sometimes strains under the pressure of fulfilling its obligations to the all-consuming Warzone platform that the series has become. Vanguard’s Gunsmith and Operators might dictate the game’s World War II fiction in weird and hilarious ways, but it can still offer the same thrills you’d expect. Still, there’s no denying that Vanguard feels like a watered down entry for the franchise, which is now more motivated by microtransactions than by telling a compelling World War II narrative.                            
85	                                At the end of the day, it’s really hard to talk about these games. I’ve reviewed two of them before and said what I needed to say there, and it still holds true to this day. Crysis 2 and 3 are great games that any FPS fan would enjoy. Crysis 1 shows its age here and there, but it’s not a rough game by any means and all three look really great in 4K. It’s a decent package for three fun FPS games with a lot going for them all for 50 bucks. If you’re into shooters and have never tried them before, or if you’re looking for a fun return to some great games, it’s hard to go wrong here.                            
85	                                Crysis Trilogy Remastered is the perfect opportunity to go through these 3 Crytek iconic games that, thanks to a very well done work with the remasters, we can save Earth as Nomad and Prophet, controlling our own nanosuits, and fighting against an alien army.                             
85	                                Revive the Nanosuit trilogy with a new hardware is really satisfying. Last decade shooters still works perfectly.                            
85	                                If you’re a fan of the Crysis series, then Crysis Trilogy Remastered is definitely going to be a collection to experience once more. Whilst the initial representation may be too buggy at present, the true value of this franchise could really shine with the right patches and some additional polish. Those yet to experience this game shouldn’t be put off by the negatives in this review; sure, there is some illusion breaking bugs, and some irritation can be caused for anyone who knows the games from the originals, but in general, this trilogy still offers up the same fantastic sci-fi stories that they always have and if you’re an FPS fan who enjoys a good story, then you really shouldn’t pass this up, especially when all 3 games are available for the price of one typical release.                            
80	                                If you're a console player and interested in some old-fashioned story-driven shooters, than Crysis Remastered Trilogy is probably well worth your attention.                            
80	                                A tidy and firm package of three of the most consistent and solid first person shooters in the history of gaming. The “Warhead” chapter is absent, but overall the creativity, the technical achievements and the vision behind the games is omnipresent and omnipotent.                             
80	                                Even without a multiplayer component here it’s hard to dismiss the value of the Crysis Remastered Trilogy. For those who have already played these games there’s nothing new and spectacular that’s going to blow your mind. But if you want to jump into it once again, this time with better and more refined graphics, you won’t regret it. It may not be as good as the new-age titles but it’s certainly no longer living in the past. Now for anyone who hasn’t played this franchise this really feels like a no-brainer. Scoop up the Crysis Remastered Trilogy for just $49.99 and you’re going to have a fantastic time!                            
80	                                I might be easily pleased these days, but I think Crysis Remastered Trilogy is an easy recommendation for anyone who loves a bit of first-person gunplay. All three campaigns are good to great, visually they look the part, and it can already be bought at a smashing price. Not the definitive package, at least on consoles, but it's very good all the same.                            
80	                                Crysis Remastered Trilogy will give plenty of players a chance to revisit three classic games, with improved visuals all round.                            
80	                                If you’re looking to experience shooter royalty for the first time, then Crysis Trilogy Remastered is the best place to start. While the series’ ever-encroaching linearity might make its first entry its most fondly remembered, tight controls and improved movement in the sequels make them well worth a playthrough, too.                            
77	                                Crysis Remastered Trilogy allows us to relive on our consoles the entire Crytek saga, which went down in history for several reasons, first and foremost the graphical fidelity one. The strongest title of the three is definitely the first one, while the second one remains the most disappointing of the group, but if you have never played these titles and love FPS games, they are worth picking up.                            
75	                                On PS5 and Xbox Series, the three games are very convincing: the real regret comes mainly from the fact that the trilogy is not offered, strictly speaking, on new generation machines, using only backward compatibility to boost its rendering. We must then draw a line on immediate loading, ray tracing or even support for DualSense features, despite a good rendering. As for the Crysis themselves, it is clear that a number of mechanisms are now aging: they remain good titles, but never speak of excellence ... It's up to you to see what you are looking for.

80	                                Although somewhat lacking on the horror front, PROJECT ZERO: Maiden of Black Water is a fun time with an interesting story and gorgeous graphics. The audio could use some improvement, but the pros far outweigh the cons.                            
80	                                Project Zero 5 is not a bad game: with its Japanese horror movie atmosphere reminiscent of The Grudge or the mythical The Ring, Koei Tecmo's survival-horror succeeds in immersing the player in its scary universe full of macabre stories and tormented spirits. Also, Gamepad is for once very well exploited with a Camera Obscura to be controlled directly with the gyroscope (or the sticks if you wish). Unfortunately, the numerous back and forths to do during the game and the general stiffness of the gameplay make the pleasure of the game fall very quickly, leaving only a nice adventure, but far from being memorable.                            
75	                                An effectively creepy atmosphere combined with an intriguing story and unique combat, Fatal Frame: Maiden of Black Water is well worth picking up. It can slog some when it forces you to revisit the same areas that you just saw and the movement is clunky and awkward, but those can't sink the rest of the enterprise into the mire.                            
70	                                Fatal Frame: Maiden of Black Water suffers from some dated design decisions and redundancies in level design, but the unique combat and evocative environments make this a worthwhile adventure for horror fans.                            
60	                                Unless you are a hardcore fan, existing players will not find much to gain from picking this up. This is a release for newcomers, which to be honest, there will be millions who would have missed this due to the platform it was originally released on. For those people, you can expect a creepy game that oozes atmosphere, but is hampered by cumbersome controls and poor pacing. A trade-off I personally feel is worth taking to experience Project Zero: Maiden of Black Water‘s bespoke approach to horror.                            
60	                                Those who love the genre and will be able to forgive its many pitfalls.                            
60	                                Project Zero: Maiden of Black Water is a strange release. It's not a remake, nor a remaster, feeling more like a re-release with a few added features. Visually, it's barely different to the Wii U Release, so if you've already played it, then there's not much I can say. However, considering the original was limited to the Wii U, with a limited audience, this version brings it over to modern consoles and the PC, keeping the excellent atmosphere and different combat system and making it control better than expected. Is it worth buying? That is very dependent on if you like horror games.                            
60	                                Project Zero: Maiden of Black Water arrives just in time to celebrate Halloween as well as the series’ 20th anniversary. Unfortunately, a combination of clunky gameplay, impractical character decisions, and overused text exposition hold this game back from where it could be. Using the camera obscura to excorcise ghosts is tense and exciting, and the exploration isn’t half bad, but it’s not enough to tip the scales in the right direction.                            
80	                                Despite the soundtrack’s chill vibes, you’ll want to keep the tissues close for this one. A year well spent getting to know a fan-favourite character better. [Issue#8, p.95]                            
80	                                Life is Strange: Wavelenghts is another intimate and delightfully queer chapter of the universe created by Deck Nine Games. Warm and sweet, Steph coming-of-age story, made of records and dies is a welcome missing link between the first Life is Strange and True Colors.                            
80	                                Taken for what it is, meaning a purely narrative additional content that still manages to introduce small gameplay elements, Life is Strange: Wavelengths proves to be an excellent DLC.                            
80	                                In the end, players will leave with two things: some great music recommendations and the craving to play Life is Strange: True Colors once again, especially if they wooed Steph while in the shoes of Alex Chen, if nothing else but to see her finally get the wholesome romance she deserves. Overall, it's only a short piece of Steph's life, to connect the dots between Before the Storm and Alex's story in True Colors, but it adds some context to her grounded attitude towards trauma and the decision she eventually makes to leave Haven Springs. Steph feels a bit out of place as a lesbian in a rural town, and she still desires the thrilling life of an indie band. Wavelengths provides the middle to Before the Storm's beginning and True Colors' end of the Steph Gingrich saga.                            
75	                                Deck Nine knows how to make the most of its characters, and in that sense the Life is Strange: True Colors DLC doesn't disappoint. Steph's story is quite emotionally intense and will appeal to fans of the first chapter of the series especially, but it stumbles on the playful front. In about two and a half hours of duration, in fact, the expansion reiterates some game mechanics too much, making them monotonous and not very varied. An additional content that remains a welcome and exciting tribute to the protagonists of the first LIS, and that at the same time is effectively linked to the incipit of True Colors, from which however we also expected something more.                             
70	                                Life is Strange: True Colors remains one of my favorite titles of 2021. Wavelengths isn’t everything I wanted when it comes to DLC. Being able to explore Haven Springs further, or at least bringing more of Haven Springs into the record store, would have provided a more satisfying experience. Still, Steph’s story is moving and does an excellent job exploring her character. If you’re a fan of hers, you’ll absolutely want to check out Wavelengths.                            
70	                                Life is Strange: True Colors has received DLC in the form of Wavelengths which, as this review reveals, is a calm yet enjoyable slice-of-life experience that focuses on Steph Gringrich. If pretending to be a DJ and finding out more about the folks of Haven intrigues you, Wavelengths is the perfect way to spend a lazy afternoon.                            
85	                                New World is a pretty damn good MMORPG. It's fun and accessible, and though it doesn't do anything truly new, it has enough little twists on existing ideas to keep me invested.                            
82	                                From the moment I began my journey in New World I felt like, outside of the specific world and story, I had been here and done this many times before, in many other MMOs. That said, New World does those familiar things very competently. It looks great and controls well, either with mouse and keyboard, or the slightly less optimized controller. Survival mechanics and crafting are core elements and not side gigs, but luckily, they are engaging and layered with depth. New World rewards the player for just about everything, all the time, and there is always something to do, whether fighting, farming or exploring and questing. It’s accessible to solo players and embraces the PvP and coop communities with a great deal of content. All MMORPGs are major time commitments by definition, so whether New World can hold your attention long term is probably a function of your expectations, and whether you connect with what the game has to offer. New World probably won’t ever surprise you, but it won’t disappoint you either.                            
80	                                New World is such a large MMO that we will have to spend our time in the vast world of Aethernum. While some mechanics or functionalities don't have much of a place nowadays, it has other things that seem to me to be genuine and cutting edge in terms of massively multiplayer online development.                            
80	                                I’m not going to pretend for a minute that I’m unaware of the fact that some people aren’t exactly happy with New World‘s current state, nor will I pretend that I disagree with everything. The game isn’t perfect, and it absolutely has some growing to do. I’m not going to pretend that I dislike the game, either, however. New World is a fun, solid MMORPG packed with plenty of enjoyable content that will keep players busy for a long, long time. Sure, it might have some imperfections, but I’m hopeful that the game will address all of those as it continues to grow—and I look forward to being a part of its community while it does.                            
80	                                While young and not perfected, New World is Amazon's first hit, a MMORPG with some classic aspects to it while others are refreshing. Its action gameplay, craft and endearing world building make for a pleasant journey, especially with no subscription. The rest will depend on Amazon capacity to entertain its community in the month to come.                            
80	                                New World has every element that an MMORPG fan needs to spend hours in front of the screen while they level up their characters and jobs nevertheless, its lack of variety of enemies and activities make it repetitive and tedious very soon. The PvP quests are great, but limited to high levels, while PvE delivers what's set to accomplish. New World can be quite entertaining if you have a lot of free time and patience, but if you don't, you might want to look somewhere else.                            
80	                                While New World isn’t a World of Warcraft or Final Fantasy XIV killer, it does prove that a new MMO can succeed. We’ll have to wait to see how they capitalize on their momentum.                             
80	                                New World does a lot of things right. Combat and crafting work very well. The world looks stunning and the game has one of the best sound designs in the history of video games. However, be sure you know what you sign up for. If you are looking for a quest-based and story-driven MMO like WoW, then New World will not make you happy. But if you enjoy exploration and PvP in a MMO, then this game is for you.                             
80	                                In New World, Amazon finally has the hit it has been chasing. However, as an MMO – with a one-time entry fee – the key part is going to be if they stick around and treat the community well with thoughtful additions, instead of asking people to shell out on pages upon pages of cosmetics. The foundation is strong, and if nothing else, it feels good to batter things with a spear.                            
80	                                New World has just had its global launch and it is obvious that it deserves some adjustments, especially at the server or PvP level. But it is nonetheless a good MMO that should delight players avid for competition or craftsmanship. The universe is catchy and the desire to travel from region to region makes us want to know more about Aeternum. The progression of our character is free, which allows us to have a certain ease in the approach to the game.                            
80	                                It is obvious that players will ask for small adjustments and additions to be made on New World, but let's not forget that the game is making its premiere and that it is already very satisfactory for its debut. It has mechanics that will appeal to players who are tired of classic MMOs and they will find a variety of elements that are very relevant. Crafting is no longer useless: it is now necessary to have professions to have a viable game experience in late and end game. The world of Aeternum will be able to take players on a journey in a new MMO that should continue to grow in beauty over time.                            
75	                                New World is a great theme park at its inauguration. Not all attractions are ready, some work well but need to be run in and others are still in the planning stage. There is absolutely no doubt that the foundations for something great are all there, benefiting from a colossal budget and substantially infinite resources, but it is equally true that what we now have in our hands is an introduction and nothing more.                            
75	                                Do I regret spending 70 hours playing New World? Absolutely not, but I hoped for something better, especially in terms of endgame. New World is a great MMO and a poor RPG. The developers need to keep working and improving their game, and I heartily hope the will, because there's considerable potential here.                            
75	                                I thoroughly enjoyed New World. I wish there was more guidance in some areas in-game, and the game does seem geared towards PvP rather than PvE. Despite these minor gripes, the game is incredible.                            
75	                                New World is a great title for new MMO fans to get themselves lost in, but it may be a struggle to entice older fans of the genre to leave the worlds they know.                            
72	                                New World brings you into the mysterious world of Aeternum after sailing into a wild storm that leaves you stranded. While there are many things to do in New World, it can often feel tedious to make any progress as the leveling system relies heavily on the player grinding out tasks.                            
70	                                Amazon's MMO is an ambitious, player-led experience, but that doesn't forgive a lack of narrative or worldbuilding. For every good idea or unique concept, it feels like it's missing the chance to take the next big step and do something more interesting...And yet, I find myself returning to Aeternum's shores just to passively enjoy its community spirit and stick it to rival factions through the community board. I just wish there was something bigger to hold me there for longer.                            
70	                                I can’t recommend New World to anyone who isn’t already 100% invested in the idea of faction politics and PvP, but there’s a solid foundation here. Give it an expansion or two, and this could turn into something truly special.                            
70	                                The crowd who’ll be left out in the cold with New World are those looking for a rich narrative adventure akin to your typical MMO. That’s not really here right now, and it's unclear what plans Amazon has in store for it. Maybe in the future, with ongoing updates, New World can evolve into something truly special.                            
70	                                New World is not a paradise for all comers by any means. It's an escape for those willing to put up with some oddly misbalanced elements to get a taste of some really excellent PvP encounters. If you have a guild ready to grind out results and become kind of the mountain then New World is worth a look.                            
70	                                There is no other way to explain it other than an all-encompassing “One more iron ore, one more dungeon run.” I’m a sucker for it. I can’t help it. I am continually swept away by the tide of grinding, progression, experience bars, little chats here and there with strangers, battles over iron ore, faction skirmishers, putting a new stove in my house, and finally hitting level 60. I am a sailor slumped on a beach huffing on a bright pink flower. My flatmate says, bleary-eyed, “Go to bed. It’s daytime outside and those trees aren’t real.”                             
70	                                I was admittedly surprised with how thoroughly I enjoyed my time with New World. From the freeform character and weapon progression to the resource gathering and faction dynamics, there’s a lot to explore and experience. That said, New World very much feels like an MMO in a very early state. There’s not a ton of Expeditions, there’s no mounts, and there’s an obvious need for balancing with features like Siege. Luckily, MMOs often get better as they age, and if Amazon Games can build upon this great foundation, they’ll have a surefire hit on their hands.                            
70	                                New World is an MMORPG for fans of the genre. Although the work that Amazon Game Studios presents has interesting ideas for its multiplayer section, this experience will not change your opinion regarding this type of games.                             
70	                                New World is one of the most beginner-friendly MMOs available, but its lacking quests and PvE makes me worried about the future. The PvP, however, is a blast.                            
69	                                Posh PvP carnage featuring a for the genre exceptional combat system.Plot, PvE and endgame are however more limited.                            
65	                                New World is an mmo that could be straight out of 2010. It hardly adds any new ideas to the genre and therefore feels dated in content. The faction system offers interesting possibilities for wars between players, but is not yet balanced. New World demands a lot of time from its players, but does not actually give anything in return that we have not seen before. Graphically, everything is fine, and although the game has microtransactions, they are only of a cosmetic nature. There is no subscription: for the entrance fee, the entire base game is open to you.                             
65	                                Amazon has done a decent job with New World with its exquisite visuals and overall environment. They just need to smooth out those rough edges and implement some mounts!                            
60	                                As it stands a little over a month after launch, New World offers a solid PvP-focused, player-driven MMORPG experience that has long been missing from the genre, albeit one seriously held back by outdated quest design and a lack of interesting endgame content. Whether that changes in the months ahead remains to be seen, but for now, New World will likely only appeal to those who crave PvP and wish to paint the map of Aeternum the color of their chosen faction, repetitive questing and lack of content be damned.                            
60	                                New World is off to a rocky start, but if Amazon can right the ship and address real player concerns, it has the chance to be something really special. But right now, it’s an okay experience overall that leaves me wanting more in order to stick around.                            
60	                                New World is a very pretty survival-MMORPG hybrid that saves its best moments for the endgame – but you have to be willing to grind like hell to get to them.                            
60	                                New World has many of the fundamentals down, but does little to innovate or bring true charm to the experience, making it feel much too generic and boring after just the first few handfull of hours.                            
60	                                New World has the mechanical foundations of a decent MMO, with passable combat and good visuals, but its hopes are extinguished at the hands of dreadful PvE design. The few distinctive experiences that it does have, locked away behind high levels as if the game knows it has precious little to offer, are not worth the hours of mind numbing grind to get there.                            
60	                                New World's engaging crafting and faction rivalries are held back by abysmal PvE and a boring world.                             
60	                                A stellar crafting experience and surprisingly slick combat aren’t enough to compensate for the flaws in New World’s humdrum and frustrating quest design.                            
100	                                Deathloop is a creative masterpiece. Refining everything that is excellent about Arkane Studios previous titles, it takes every single dial and cranks it up to 11.                            
100	                                Deathloop encases fun investigation work and satisfying combat in a unique time loop mechanic to create a tremendously satisfying adventure.                            
100	                                Despite these gripes, Deathloop on the PS5 offers some fantastically unique features that properly elevate the experience in new and creative ways. It’s the definitive place to play the game if you’re on console – though it’s not like you have much choice.                            
100	                                A true tour de force from Arkane that is bound to be one of the year's best and most important games.                            
97	                                With a game that has players re-living the day on multiple occasions, you’d be forgiven for thinking that it would become stale. But each day plays differently as you learn clues to the visionaries and their daily patterns. And even though the Eternalists inhabit the same locations when you visit at the same time period, the skills and weapons you have acquired and imbued with Residuum allows gamers to play each section in a completely different manner. Whether you want to play a stealthy style game and methodically take out your enemies as you uncover the island’s mysteries, or blast you way through groups of Eternalists, Deathloop allows you to do so. But no matter which style you choose, it is so satisfying once you finally close the loop.                            
90	                                Deathloop is one of the best games to hit in 2021. It’s confident, it doesn’t take itself too seriously, and it combines what makes Arkane games great – and makes it better.                            
90	                                Deathloop is yet another clear example of Arkane's potential, with the studio refining its Prey and Dishonored formula, injecting it with a massive dose of style, creating a game that overflows with confidence and creativity. Deathloop’s mix of genres and flawless execution makes it one of the strongest candidates for best game of 2021, burying any doubts about Arkane's talent.                            
90	                                Outside of some annoying crashes and mishaps, Deathloop remains a stellar game with a brilliant premise, refreshing mechanics, and delightful characters. You'll repeat the same day and retread the same paths over and over. But, replayability is enhanced given how you'll discover new secrets and abilities to help you progress.                            
90	                                Deathloop is one of Arkane's finest games yet, featuring incredible gameplay, excellent levels, tons of charm, and writing that's sure to bring a smile to your face. Watch out for the overly demanding specs and the occasional performance dip on PC, though.                            
90	                                Deathloop is another incredible title from Arkane, once again putting their skills in developing both quality stealth and first-person action to good use and blending it with time loops in order to create one of the year’s most memorable games. This is thanks in part to a clever twist that encourages exploration to its fullest in order to find Blackreef’s best mysteries and the most creative solutions to its puzzles.                            
89	                                A thoughtful response to Dishonored that makes for an entertaining stealth shooter in its own right, but it's the multiplayer invasions that make Deathloop sing.                            
85	                                Deathloop overdoes it now and then but remains a fun shooter withinventive time loop mechanics.                            
82	                                Deathloop is a welcome breath of fresh air for all fans of titles like Deux Ex, Dishonored or even Bioshock or Splinter Cell. It may in no way match the top games of the genre in terms of quality, but it still offers immersive sim entertainment and keeps the genre in the spotlight.                            
80	                                Deathloop is able to break the cycle of repetitive AI encounters and uneven performance thanks to an interesting story, strong characters, and enticing exploration.                            
80	                                Deathloop turns both succeeding and failing into learning experiences and never makes you miss the lack of a quicksave option. It’s a mean feat that sets it apart from other games, and one of several reasons why it should be on the list of any immersive sim fans out there. It might not be Arkane’s best game and Blackreef may struggle clearly defining a personality for itself, but it’s certainly no stranger to great moments.                            
80	                                Deathloop is a unique mix between FPS, sci-fi and mystery in a 70's case. Trapped in a time loop, Colt Vahn must understand and memorize every nook and cranny of a strange island and it's strange cast of vilains. Despite some kind of redundancy in its last hours, Deathloop is an intelligent, beautiful, singular and well-written adventure not to miss.                             
80	                                Comfortable in the exercise of style imposed by the time loop, the artists of Arkane signed with Deathloop a very good FPS that is as interesting as it is wacky. More action-oriented than a Dishonored, Bethesda's title quickly reaches a level of depth but also of complexity that is rare even for a work by Arkane. The repetitive aspect necessarily linked to the theme of the game is intelligently lessened by the variety of situations, the chance of encounters (with Julianna) and the rise in power. Enjoying a concept of loop without running out of time, Deathloop encourages experiments of all kinds in a universe that contrasts drastically with what the people of Lyon have already produced. And it's good to see that the studio doesn't sing us the same song ... over and over.                             
80	                                Deathloop is a rewarding and ambitious experience that smartly combines Arkane’s immersive sim bedrock with a fluid nonlinear structure. Its smooth gameplay and naturalistic narrative stylings are interrupted by lacklustre PC performance, though it fulfils a puzzle-box Groundhog Day fantasy few other games have been ambitious enough to touch.                            
80	                                DEATHLOOP is a cathartic blend of stealth, gunplay and powers that culminate in a satisfying gameplay loop as you explore the eccentric island of Blackreef. Whilst the narrative payoffs don't always live up to the intriguing premise, there's an undeniable sense of style and substance that help carry the game into really favourable territory. Knowledge really is power in DEATHLOOP and there's a pleasurable novelty to much of the game's design that allows it to feel engaging even when the player's hand is held a little too tightly. Even within a year of time loop releases, DEATHLOOP stands out as its own unique beast worth experiencing.                            
77	                                Too much hand-holding, some glaring omissions in the narrative and its  somewhat weak AI do let Deathloop down, but still, it’s a rare and exciting game made for both fans of Corvo Attano and those who never set foot in the Empire of the Isles before.                            
75	                                Deathloop is a good experience that mixes genres and inspirations against the backdrop of an assassination-based time puzzle. The island and the characters are full of personality, which makes the exploration and discovery of secrets satisfying at first. But you quickly realize that the title doesn't have the means of its ambitions, it's not a very good FPS, nor a good puzzle game, and it doesn't reach the level of Hitman on infiltration and creativity of assassinations. Despite its limitations, you still have a good time on Blackreef Island, and it's fun to progress from loop to loop, getting faster and faster while killing your targets at lightning speed. The multiplayer invasions also add the edge of difficulty and challenge that the rest of the game struggles to offer.                            
74	                                It’s hard to recommend Deathloop to anyone. By action standards, the game is plainly boring: it’s basically the same 4 maps over and over again with no variety in enemies or weapons. Cause-and-effect timeloop puzzle gameplay is underwhelming as well: aside from the proper solution, there are very few things to try. [Issue#255, p.56]                            
70	                                I applaud Arkane for switching up the Dishonored stealth/action formula here, and for addressing a few of the issues Dishonored had. Deathloop just feels too limited by comparison, though, and too repetitive by half besides. I know a lot of people who really like it, but it fell pretty flat for me.                            
70	                                It feels sometimes like Deathloop couldn’t decide what it really wanted to be. Stealth game? Bullet opera? Retro-cool ‘60s spy romp? Mind-melting time travel story? When it tries to be all of these things at once, it ends up not being very much of anything. I liked the core concept but after twenty hours I didn’t feel like I knew more about how an island could get stuck living the same day over and over than I did at the outset.                            
96	                                NHL 22 really takes a big stride forward in the franchise. Having it on a PS5 is a big part of what makes the difference in some ways. The haptic feedback really gives the game another level. NHL games have gotten stale in years past (15-18 come to mind in some ways). Over the past few releases, EA Vancouver has taken it to newer heights and this is a leap in a great direction. I haven’t been this excited to try and run a franchise into the ground because I have no idea what I am doing, or go pro and take on the greats for the cup.                            
91	                                I really dug NHL 22, the new engine, the tried and true smooth gameplay, it hit all the check boxes for me. I do wish they had a new mode or two since I last played the series two years ago and that $10 next gen “fee” can be a tough pill to swallow for fans that pick up the release every year, but it still gets my recommended seal of approval. EA survives the power play, but I don’t know if they can handle another one (another hockey pun, sorry).                            
90	                                The first truly next-gen sport title, the completely overhauled NHL 22 is a near-perfect marriage with the PS5.                            
86	                                NHL 22 is a huge comeback for Electronic Arts’ NHL-franchise. The game delivers big-time thanks to the Frostbite-Engine and enhanced gameplay. NHL 22 is definitely a game to watch.                            
80	                                NHL 22 didn't do a whole lot to improve on its predecessor, but it didn't have to. The important part is that the development team didn't do anything to change the game for the worse. The franchise was already a ship sailing smoothly, all anyone needed to do was keep it steady.                             
80	                                NHL 22 does an excellent job at bringing back old arcade-y mechanics and blending it with today's simulation quality presentation in a way that works together rather than against itself. Some modes could still use a refresh, but the core gameplay of NHL 22 shows that the NHL series is really hitting its stride with this release.                            
80	                                NHL 22 on current-generation consoles is the best NHL experience that has released in some time. It also provides the biggest change from last gen to current gen consoles of any EA Sports game yet. It still has its issues at its core with how the AI plays and there are bugs that crop up often, but the overall experience feels fresh and the game looks much improved. The lighting and reflections provide the biggest boost while Frostbite brings more realism to player faces and jerseys. I feel more could have been included with Frostbite on the physics side, but this will come in the future. While the modes remain the same, the updates to each are sufficient and the addition of Superstar X-Factors allows for a game-changing experience. Online, if not getting disconnected, generally works as it needs to. NHL 22 offers the right feel for a new console that a lot of sports games haven’t provided in the last two generations.                            
80	                                NHL 22 is the de facto hockey gaming experience and the energy that went into refining the current product was not spent in vain.                            
79	                                NHL 22’s gameplay is substantially unchanged from its predecessors. The Frostbite engine brings a breath of fresh air to the graphics, but the gaming experience does not differ dramatically from what has been seen in the past. The result is a fun and full of game modes title, which however would need an update in the game mechanics to be able to take it one step further.                            
75	                                At the end of the day, NHL 22 just feels like a transition to a kind of gameplay that would eventually feel even more real, probably not this year but in the upcoming releases. It’s still fun to play, and the graphics are clearly the best improvement on new-gen consoles, but otherwise, those who want to get the game on old-gen wouldn’t necessarily notice a massive refresh.                            
75	                                Playing it safe, NHL 22 features a plethora of fun yet all-too familiar online and offline modes that play well and look great. The engine upgrades it received this year and enhanced animations make it one of the best hockey sims out there even though it has the potential to be so much more. Fans of the series will feel some slight improvements, and newcomers will receive a robust package that will keep them busy all throughout the season.                            
73	                                Playing NHL 22 is like watching a predictable team. On the one hand, there’s comfort in knowing what to expect. On the other, it’s not fun seeing the same plays over and over again.                             
70	                                It's odd that it took EA this long to bring their flagship Frostbite engine to their NHL franchise, but now that it's here in NHL 22, the wait was certainly worth it, as the game has never looked or played better.                            
70	                                NHL 22 makes a careful and mostly smooth transition to a new engine and the new console generation. The new ice looks great, and some gameplay tweaks are enjoyable, but beneath the surface the experience still feels very much the same.                            
65	                                I can’t see the NHL franchise reaching the heights of its mid-2000s glory years anytime soon, but at least we have the Frostbite engine in there to start building upon. It took far too long to arrive, though; it’s here now. And while I can see the potential for it to one day have this series feeling exciting again, I don’t see that happening for a long time. But, hey, it’s the only hockey game in town, so I guess I’ll see you on the ice.                            
60	                                Aside from minor changes, everything else is pretty much in the same state that it was last year, except you can now pay the next-gen premium price for it. NHL 22 is still the best hockey game you can buy (mostly due to the lack of other options), but I'd strongly advise against it if you have played any other NHL title in the past few years. The series has been stagnating, and NHL 22 doesn't indicate any will to make meaningful changes, which is a shame because this would've been the perfect cut-off point to do something new and interesting.                            
60	                                Making a debut on new hardware has its pros and cons, but for NHL 22, the overt emphasis on Superstar X-Factors was a huge gamble to take that did not pay off. If this is your first NHL game in a while, then there is a solid foundation in NHL 22 with various game modes that can appeal. For fans who are hoping for more, however, it is disappointing to find little to no improvements despite all the hype, just like a draft pick that turned out to be a lemon.                            
60	                                NHL 22 is enjoyable, but feels very similar to last year despite using a new game engine. Too much focus has been put on implementing Superstar X-Factor abilities and little else.                            
60	                                This should have been NHL 22’s coming-out party. Everything was in place for this to be a transformative season on a fresh new platform. Unfortunately, the next-generation jump feels more like a stop-gap solution than a proper evolution. If you already have last year’s installment, I would be hard-pressed to find a legitimate reason to make the jump. Hopefully, the next outing will focus on bringing a more innovative offering to the rink, because lord knows this time around isn’t going to set the stadium on fire.                            
60	                                The difference between a good or bad NHL game is often tiny. For the most part, moving the experience forward in any meaningful way is enough to get me to buy in. Maybe that’s a massive improvement to gameplay and AI, or a new mode that becomes a staple of the series. These wins are often enough to make the longstanding bugs or omissions tolerable. Problems arise when what’s on offer as the year’s shiny distraction falls flat. In NHL 22, improved visuals are there but are buggy at any given moment. Superstar X-Factor Abilities are cool but alone are not enough. NHL 22 doesn’t feel like the next leap forward for video game hockey. It barely feels like meaningful DLC.                            
60	                                NHL 22 puts a lot of energy into promoting Superstar X-Factors, but even giving big-name players unique special abilities doesn’t have the significant gameplay implications you’d expect. This is a strong year for out-of-the-box balancing, though, and the various arcade modes have their charms, even if they’re just limited sidebars. It’s an uneven jump into a new generation visually. Plus, the choppy commentary, inconsistent tone, and repetitive cut aways during stoppages make it harder to become immersed in the hockey than it’s been at the series’ peaks.                            
60	                                With NHL 22, EA's classic hockey game finally gets a new game engine, which gives us better physics, graphics, and animations. As usual, we also get a ton of different games modes that will make most hockey fans happy. What we do not get, however, is enough notable gameplay improvements. Even though the improved physics helps a fair amount, plenty of old shortcomings remains. That said, NHL 22 is a great hockey game, but there is still room for plenty of improvements.                             
60	                                NHL 22 delivers some good moment-to-moment hockey along with a needed visual upgrade, but the franchise feels tired and worn out.                            
60	                                If you’re completely new to EA’s NHL series, then by all means, this is a must-play and would be a 9/10 otherwise. For myself, however, I’ve been there and I’ve done this. In some cases many years ago. It’s time for something new.                            
60	                                NHL 22 surprises by making its debut on a new console without removing any of its modes, but those who played NHL 21 may find this version a little too familiar. X-Factors on paper should be a game-changer but are mostly underwhelming. The switch to Frostbite does massively improve the fidelity of the rink – even if character models still look downright demonic – but should that really be the biggest change to the game? The ultimate question is: can the price increase be justified on the PS5? And given how little really has changed from last year to this year, the answer has to be a “no”.                            
100	                                I’m still jugging through the story and exploring Yara and having a great time. It’s a good time to invest in a game like this when there aren’t too many new titles in the genre coming soon. The shortcomings are minimal and I’m sure I have a lot more to discover. Fans of Giancarlo Esposito will enjoy his inclusion, as he does a fantastic job of playing a villain you love to hate.                            
92	                                Everything is wrapped in an impressive graphic section, and that will make us feel that we are facing a true next-gen title. Obviously some minor problems can be attributed to the game, such as an AI that sometimes acts in a somewhat strange way or some typical bugs of an open world game and that do not cloud the experience too much. Removing this, the truth is that it is difficult for me to get any more black points out of this Far Cry 6, which for me is, without a doubt, the best game in the saga.                             
91	                                Far Cry 6 is both exceptional and surprising. It gave me more than I ever could have expected from the franchise and has redefined what a Far Cry game can be going forward.                            
90	                                Far Cry 6 is as Far Cry as Far Cry gets. It may be cut from the same cloth as previous entries almost identically, but when the action is this fun and the world is this expansive and full of things to do, I’m not going to complain. The title alone will let you know if that’s for you, but if it is, you’re in for one hell of a ride.                            
90	                                Far Cry 6 is the ultimate exponent of Ubisoft's open world formula. It’s a great pleasure to explore the island of Yara and all its corners, where we have enormous freedom and options to face all of its challenges. Giancarlo Espostio shines as Antón Castillo, a villain that will go down in Far Cry history, even if the other characters in the narrative are not up to him. A must for fans of open world games.                            
90	                                Far Cry 6 keeps the spirit of the saga but seeks to innovate with new mechanics that try to leave behind what no longer works or tires the player.                            
90	                                Far Cry 6 is without a doubt Ubisoft’s most ambitious entry into the series, offering a huge map and more activities than you could possibly want. Giving us a classic Far Cry experience the whole way through, with a smattering of new ideas and fresh takes, Far Cry 6 is perfect for fans of the series. Although some of the newer mechanics don’t seem to have the desired effect, I can still safely say that this is my favourite entry into the series to date, and I recommend you book a trip to Yara as soon as you can. Viva Libertad!                            
90	                                Far Cry 6 doesn't do a lot to shake up a tried-and-true formula, but still offers up an engaging story and plenty of enjoyable open world mayhem in the series' best setting to date.                            
90	                                Far Cry 6 is a gripping and exciting thrill ride from the opening moments, delivering the best entry the franchise has had in years.                            
90	                                Sticking to a well-practiced formula but making smart, thoughtful enhancements, Far Cry 6 is a satisfying adventure through a beautiful setting in the tropical island of Yara. Some of its darker themes are glossed over a bit too quickly, but the story and the incredibly likeable characters you’ll meet along the way make for a memorable romp, with a once again compelling villain and, for the first time, a hero to truly root for. With a gigantic open world filled with delightful distractions, Far Cry 6 is the strongest entry in the series and is a great example of evolving a popular franchise into something special.                            
90	                                As the most expansive instalment in the franchise to date, Far Cry 6 is literally the GTA V of Far Cry games, with a solid story, vibrant, engaging characters and no shortage of things to do alone or online with a friend; for FPS action-adventure fans this is a MUST BUY.                            
87	                                Far Cry 6 may be my favourite entry into the series. The ridiculous weapons, wonderful Amigos, beautiful scenery and charismatic Esposito made it a fantastic experience for me. Although it doesn’t ‘reinvent the wheel’, it knows it’s audience and did improve and add some new ideas. If you enjoy the Far Cry series, you should definitely make some time to visit Yara.                            
85	                                Far Cry 6 successfully manages to reinvent the formula into the best version of the series. If you have never touched a Far Cry game, or have been irked by some of the changes since Far Cry 3, this is your entry point. Even better, it is one of the few games that have come out since the launch of PS5 and Xbox Series X to deliver a full AAA experience that doesn’t feel rushed or unfinished. Along with the buttery smooth framerate from the Xbox Series X, this feels like one of the first games made with next-gen as a priority. Far Cry 6 is an amazing journey in one of the most expansive iterations of the series to date. With explosive performances from the whole cast, it’s a game that old fans and intrigued wannabe guerrillas shouldn’t sleep on.                            
85	                                Far Cry 6 is a great representative of the formula that Ubisoft has been refining. The modifications introduced, such as the elimination of the skill tree, have suited the game quite well. The story in this installment, the villain, the allies, every element that contributes to the narrative are something remarkable. Plus the setting looks exceptionally good. However, it's still not a next-gen experience. The main flaw the game has is in the AI of the enemies which makes them often easy to defeat.                             
85	                                Far Cry 6 is a solid installment in the series full of fun moments, and a giant map that you can explore at your leisure. However, a series of flaws in several of its aspects prevent this revolution from being as effective as Ubisoft wants it to be.                             
85	                                Make no mistakes; Far Cry 6 is, without a doubt, the best Far Cry game in a long time. The game brings back the exotic locations we’ve been missing since Far Cry 3 and Far Cry 4 and adds yet another charismatic antagonist to its storied pantheon of villains. But more importantly, it’s a joy to play, with a unique arsenal full of character and breadth of content that is not only comprehensive but engaging.                            
85	                                Far Cry 6 may not move the needle much in terms of innovation, but it executes what makes these games extremely fun to play.                            
83	                                Despite some of the zannyness of the overall experience, the meaty “gritty and grounded” story content is top shelf, and it’s difficult to not just want more and more of Esposito’s Castillo. And you’ll definitely be playing awhile, especially if you choose to go all-in on the game’s many treasure hunts and other game-world challenges.                            
82	                                Far Cry 6 welcomes us to a fascinating setting in the middle of the Caribbean with a good dose of personality, adequate characters, a great sense of humor, and new mechanics. This is a game that you will enjoy especially if you are Latin American and a follower of the series. However, the core of gameplay remains almost intact, which makes this new installment feel like a skin that also comes with its fair share of bugs.                            
82	                                Far Cry 6 is going to be somewhat divisive. Those that enjoy the series for its sandbox and the ability to wreak havoc with a large assortment of weapons and vehicles may find this to be the best the series has ever been. Those, like me, who enjoyed the antagonists, and the more scripted main missions may be disappointed to see the new villain, played by the brilliant Giancarlo Espacito, almost completely wasted. He barely makes a presence and when he does, the series is too comfortable treading the same ground as past titles. Nonetheless, this is an excellent Open-World shooter that trades any surprises it may have for very solid, streamlined Ubisoft gameplay.                            
80	                                This feels like a far more honest take on what Far Cry is to most people: a joyful, chaotic toybox. There’s room for improvement – the questionable Latin American representation, for a start – but there’s no doubt this is something of an awakening for the series, exploring ideas I’m excited to see refined in iterations to come. In particular, doing away with the cumbersome pretence of political salvation leaves you free to pick and choose your own adventure, whether that’s toppling Castillo or just being crowned Gran Primo champion. Like Yara, Far Cry 6 is brimming with potential – you just have to step up and shape it.                            
80	                                Far Cry 6 is a slow burner, but once it gets going it really sinks those hooks. Fans of the series will have a blast, whether alone or through the cooperative options. Granted, the menus can sometimes over complicate things, and the cutscene stutters are annoying, but the main point to take away is that if you love open world games, especially those which provide fun, excitement and the freedom of choice, then come to Yara. It's not a huge revolution, but it's a fun one.                            
80	                                Far Cry 6 is… exactly that. If you enjoy the formula of the series, this new entry will give many, many hours of fun, but don’t expect anything new or revolutionary.                            
80	                                We end up with a very efficient production, reconnecting with the exotic atmosphere specific to the saga and supported by some commendable efforts in terms of storytelling. Solid Far Cry, no doubt.                             
80	                                It’s illustrative of the broader conflict Far Cry 6 finds itself facing with, well… itself. It wants to spin a more involved narrative, but steps back before things get too serious. Yaran Stories hint at deeper worldbuilding, though adhering to the standard Far Cry and open world structure means staleness creeps into exploration and guerrilla activities. Juan Cortez was more accurate than he realized when he recruited Dani to Libertad. Far Cry 6 prefers playing guerrilla over more serious reflection because “blowing up shit is fun,” and Ubisoft just isn’t quite ready to give that up yet.                             
80	                                Far Cry 6 smooths over a lot of the bumps that have cropped up in the past few games and even though it misses some steps, especially with its new inventory system, it's the best the series has been in years.                            
80	                                Although struggling to propose a convincing villain, Far Cry 6 offers a lot of gameplay innovations that make this chapter one of the most fun to play.                            
80	                                Ubisoft knows how to make a fun open-world FPS, but the series that once famously saw a villain wax poetic about insanity seems to have forgotten its own definition of the term.                            
78	                                Far Cry 6 is another well-crafted entry in Ubisoft's long-running franchise. While the framework of the series is still in place, the title introduces welcome changes such as a real protagonist and extensive customization that make this an improvement on its predecessor.                            
76	                                Far Cry 6 is again -and that doesn't surprise anyone- a gigantic game, and not everything in the enormous stream of (side) missions is equally fun, funny or seems to add something to the whole. So you will regularly wonder what you are doing and why, while you will often hope in vain that the next mission is one with a role for Giancarlo Esposito. But with so much content, there is more than enough fun to be had and you will definitely get your Yaran Peso value.                             
75	                                At the moment, it’s still more Far Cry. The upside of that: It’s loads and loads of fun, story be damned.                            
75	                                Far Cry 6 immerses us in a large open world with a ton of possibilities and a great cast of characters, but it fails to make a real splash compared to previous installments in the series, while also providing a too-low challenge level to the player.                            
70	                                Far Cry 6 is a fun return to the series that feels both familiar and fresh. The new gear and weapons systems are compellingly fun, and the setting of Yara is a joy to get lost in. It doesn't quite escape the series' trademark foibles, but the interlocking gameplay systems and mechanics mesh satisfyingly to create a compelling open-world adventure. Far Cry 6 does enough to push the franchise's issues to the background most of the time, offering up an enjoyable experience that looks good, plays well and succeeds in capturing the essence of the series.                            
70	                                Far Cry 6 is just another Far Cry game, one that desperately wants to utilize the imagery of a revolution without having anything meaningful to say about one.                            
70	                                Far Cry 6 has some explosive action, but in my 25-or-so hours of gameplay the stretches between the most explosive missions bring the experience down. Yara is huge and full of things to explore, but exploration should not mean "walk 1000 in-game meters to get an objective that sends me 2000 meters in the opposite direction. Every character is expertly portrayed--not the least of which is Giancarlo Esposito, whose Anton Castillo ranks right near the top of best Far Cry villains. The world and the people in it are interesting, interesting enough to overcome the monotony, but getting there can certainly be difficult. Far Cry 6 doesn't move the needle at all, but it still holds its own amongst the other shooter games available.                            
70	                                Far Cry 6 is like Far Cry 5, 4, and 3. Despite an incredible performance from Giancarlo Esposito of Breaking Bad fame, there's very little new or fresh about this latest sandbox shooter.                            
60	                                Far Cry 6 sits at the dead-end of a decade of sandboxes. Existing primarily as a sprawling checklist, its story shows flashes of excellence in a barrage of bad jokes and sometimes fun but familiar tasks.                            
60	                                Far Cry 6 starts off strong with a haunting and pretty realistic sequence. During the adventure, we get plenty of similar scenes, but also the exact opposite - and everything in between. It creates an incredibly disjointed experience, but it's actually not as bad as it sounds since the actual gameplay is varied and enjoyable. Instead, it is the high number of bugs and, to say the least, strange behavior from some of the computer controlled characters that lowers the enjoyment a notch.                             
55	                                Starting to feel like a case of diminishing returns, Far Cry 6 retreads the same formula that's stood the series in good stead for a while, but it's a formula that's starting to wear a bit thin. Still, there's some fun to be had here, despite there being little that's new or innovative.                            
50	                                But the "6" in "Far Cry 6" means you know what you're getting at this point, so none of this should be exceptionally surprising. Longtime fans were worried about things like reduced customizations for Dani and the first-person cutscenes, but the real issue here is that the formula feels less sustainable now more than ever. The big, beautiful country of Yara was squandered by Far Cry staples, and it'd be a shame to see that happen to whatever world comes next.                             
40	                                Far Cry 6 barely hangs together on the strength of the gameplay loop it inherits from its predecessors. Beyond the addition of some fun new toys, like the “resolver” weapons and Supremo backpacks, nearly every design change is mystifyingly for the worse, and the mismatch between the gameplay and storytelling ambitions is more conspicuous than ever.                            
87	                                NBA 2K22 brings major improvements to its gameplay, making it more balanced and suitable for all types of players, while also offering us a next-gen graphic rendering at the edge of photorealism. The picture is completed by the usual overwhelming number of modes, among which the further improved MyCareer is the absolute king.                            
85	                                NBA 2K22 returns with a new shooting system, gameplay that focuses on defense and several new game modes that will have you gripping the pad for hours.                            
85	                                NBA 2K22 is a very ambitious title, perhaps too much so.                            
85	                                Immense in substance and respectable in form. 2K22 is worthy of the new generation of consoles, with gameplay and a career mode that erase the many faults of the past year.                            
84	                                NBA 2K22 improves gameplay and makes it more challenging when attacking, but makes defending more fun and fair. The additions in MyCareer mode are surprising at first, but then become a bit of a drag.                             
80	                                While it may be generally the same game as last year, If you skipped out on last year’s edition of NBA 2K this may be the year for you. Mechanically the game has improved and other than having to pay for VC to compete against other players I think you’ll find some enjoyment in playing My Career games or just with some friends.                            
80	                                NBA 2K22 is a great basketball game. In fact it's probably the best basketball game out there and actually hitting the court and playing games is thrilling, exciting, and looks brilliant. And alongside that, MyNBA will eat away at your life; fantastically detailed and absorbing, while MyTEAM will cater to the many. It’s only MyCAREER which lets it down                            
80	                                On the court NBA 2K22 is one of the best basketball simulations to date. Off the court the game has lots of limits: living in The City isn't fun, and this hub looks like a Playoff commercial.                            
80	                                NBA 2K22 is an excellent next-gen addition to the franchise on Xbox Series X, delivering revamped gameplay that feels better than ever before on the court, smoother transitions between modes and all manner of graphical bells and whistles to boot. My Career's new City area has been well implemented and could well be a huge timesink for those who are into that mode and, although there's no other major changes to speak of, what's here is undoubtedly still the slickest basketball ticket in town right now.                            
75	                                NBA 2K22 is probably best entry that the series has seen in many years. On the court everything flows exactly as it should with many improvements from last year. Unfortunately, microtransactions are still rampant everywhere in the game, and to be able to compete online with your created character or in MyTeam you're almost forced to spend money if you actually want to be competitive. If you have skipped the series in the last year or two, it may be time to take a look now. It is not best of all time, but it has taken a very big step in the right by listening suggestions from its players.                            
75	                                NBA 2K22 has a few things that make this upgrade feel worthy. The new play mechanics are excellent, and it continues to excel on the presentation front. The microtransactions are still super gross and I wish some of the other modes such as Blacktop would get a proper overhaul as they are starting to feel dated. Still being the only NBA game in town it does upgrade nicely. I found myself deleting the old version to play this one, and not being a huge NBA fan that is saying something.                            
74	                                NBA 2K22 continues to assert the series' reputation as one of the best sports sims in the business. It's an incredibly enjoyable game to play, even if the options surrounding the on-court action continue to be maddeningly inconsistent.                            
70	                                It appears that NBA 2K has finally started to take the “next step” into greater gaming possibilities. Though MyPlayer needs a good amount of tuning and streamlining before reaching the heights of past story modes, it hints at bigger things down the line. But, based solely on the thrilling, beautiful, on-court presentation and gameplay, 2K22 is still a tremendous achievement.                            
70	                                As solid as it’s ever been on the court, NBA 2K22 is still an astonishingly good sports game, but its continued reliance on cynical microtransactions in MyCareer and MyTeam leave a sour taste.                            
70	                                NBA 2K22 makes some appreciated improvements to on-the-court gameplay and tries some refreshing, if not entirely successful innovations in MyCareer that make this year’s version feel like a bit more than just a roster update.                            
67	                                It isn’t terrible but there is no denying that the NBA 2K franchise is on a downward trend. The focus on everything but the Basketball is this game’s biggest sin, one that almost ruins the entire experience.                            
60	                                Yes, this is still the best way to play a simulation of the beloved sport, but with each passing year it seems like there's less and less emphasis on the Basketball itself and most of the time and effort go to improving "The City" and the microtransactions filled "MyTeam". You know - the fluff.                            
60	                                As a big basketball fan and avid player of sports games, it’s hard not to have a love and hate relationship with the NBA 2K series, and NBA 2K22 is no exception. The basketball gameplay itself is as good as it’s ever been, and it genuinely feels satisfying to move the ball around, shoot, and play defense. However, modes like MyCareer are heavily bogged down by useless baggage, and a strong emphasis on microtransactions. Spotty servers mean that even the best parts of the game are often hard to enjoy. MyNBA is the only aspect of NBA 2K22 that provided a thoroughly enjoyable experience with practically nothing to complain about. NBA 2K22 gets in its own way, but there’s some genuinely great things there if you’re willing to endure it.                            
87	                                As a lifelong Sonic fan, I’m glad I was finally able to play Colours, and in the best possible fashion thanks to the nice audio/visual upgrade. The core gameplay is great, and the Wisps add far more than I thought they would to proceedings. Some of the classic issue with 3D Sonic games remain, but these are limited in what is otherwise a great time.                            
80	                                Sonic Colors: Ultimate may not be truly ultimate, but it’s a well worthwhile return to an oft-missed game.                            
80	                                Sonic Colors: Ultimate is a fantastic remaster of a much-loved title in the series. There are a few hiccups in the road with awful cutscenes and lacklustre unlocks. It's classic Sonic in a 3D setting and your enjoyment will stem from your love of the series. If you're looking for a reinvention of the formula, this probably isn't for you, but if you want to experience the iconic series with refined gameplay, beautiful visuals and tons of replayability, this is the best 3D Sonic game to grace Xbox since Sonic Generations.                            
78	                                Sonic Colors: Ultimate is a great remaster that lacks something new to engage those players of the original version.                            
75	                                Sonic Colors Ultimate is a game that everyone will enjoy, and it is without a doubt the best version of the game since its release. I believe that with this game you will have a full experience tailored to what you want to delve into. However, it's a shame that not all parts of the game have been treated with the same care in this remaster.                            
72	                                Sonic Colours Ultimate isn't too convincing as a remaster, but it's still one of the best Sonic games of the last two decades. It doesn't fix the shortcomings of the first game and it also introduces some bugs and balancing issues, but it remains fun and spectacular; it' recommended especially to those who have never played the original.                            
70	                                Sonic Colors Ultimate is definitely conjuring up memories of the 3D Sonic era in its execution. This game was considered a hidden gem back in the day, but really is just one of the better 3D Sonic games. It still doesn’t come close to matching the excitement of the classic style or even the more recent Sonic Mania. Sonic just works best in 2D and while Colors does some interesting things with its game play, it still only serves as the best of a worse situation.                            
70	                                Luckily, the original Sonic Colours stands tall, featuring fun, exploratory gameplay and it is rewarding replaying levels to attain higher ranks. The 3D sections are far and few between, but the ones that are there are fun. The 2D gameplay is vastly improved from Sonic Generations with tighter controls and added variety in the form of Wisp abilities. Ultimate adds a lick of new paint to bring this to the Xbox platform, of which it is recommended to play on either Xbox Series X|S to get the standard performance that players have come to expect. Rival Rush is a fun mode, but there are only six acts and some of these levels are incredibly short. The other additions that Ultimate has added are superfluous, but don't do anything to really damage the core game either. If Sonic Colours doesn't exist in your library and you are a fan of the Blue Blur then there is no excuse to not pick this up.                            
70	                                A remaster of any already existing game may not have been the first choice, but Sonic Colors: Ultimate on Xbox is still a solid entry. Fans that played the original on the Nintendo Wii may not find anything to warrant another purchase here, as the work gone into the remaster comes across as a little rushed in places. Gameplay wise however, Sonic Colors: Ultimate is up there with the best 3D Sonic entries.                            
70	                                A fine remaster of a good 3D Sonic game, Sonic Colours: Ultimate delivers speedy thrills aplenty, with its rainbow of Wisps injecting a smart twist to platforming. With more than enough replay value to keep you coming back, Sonic Colours: Ultimate will last far beyond its initial 4-5 hour runtime and slake your thirst for speed.                            
70	                                Sonic Colors was already a great game when it was released on the Wii and Sonic Colors: Ultimate doesn't detract from the original experience, barring the aforementioned issues with the Switch port. The new content is underwhelming, but the whole package still stands up and it upholds the game's reputation as one of the best 3D entries in the series.                            
60	                                Sonic Colors Ultimate has very little to make it an essential purchase, unless of course you are a huge fan of the original and want a sugary nostalgia rush.                            
80	                                Maneater: Truth Quest is for those Maneater fans who only stopped playing because they completed everything the base game had to offer. This new expansion ups the challenge, but at the cost of repeated mission types. The narration steals the show throughout every moment of gameplay. Now, you can add conspiracies and bull shark facts to the useless knowledge Maneater has taught us, and yet, I’m all here for it.                            
75	                                Overall I had a fun ten or so hours uncovering the “truth”, the DLC’s final encounter was an adequate challenge that had me at the edge of my seat. Although what slightly mars my experience was the several Unreal Engine crashes I experienced during gameplay and one of these crashes actually created a soft lock which I cannot recover because of my reliance on the game’s auto save system. So while my Truth Quest Progress will never reach 100%, I can only hope other players will not have completion slip from their grasp. At the price of $14.99, Maneater: Truth Quest is a good extension to the Maneater experience and for those inclined…it’s out there.                            
70	                                Maneater: Truth Quest isn’t without its issues. At times, the lack of mission variety can make you feel like you’re treading water. And while the new setting and commentary on the ridiculousness of internet conspiracy theories work well, the gameplay doesn’t feel like a cohesive part of the narrative. In Maneater, you had a tried-and-true tale of revenge with exciting twists and a satisfying conclusion. Truth Quest certainly offers witty writing and flawless narration. It’s just a shame that they almost feel wasted without meaningful missions to support them. Despite these issues, Maneater: Truth Quest still manages to dredge up more of what kept the base game so addicting. Upgrading your shark into a radioactive killing machine is hugely entertaining. And the new bounty hunter missions and apex hunts are fun and deliver a meaty challenge to those eager to dip their fins back in the water.                            
70	                                Maneater: Truth Quest might not completely deliver on its irreverence this time around, but being a mega still delights.                            
60	                                Truth Quest doesn’t add much to Maneater’s shallow sandbox, but the stuff it does add is over-the-top, ridiculous fun. Unfortunately, it’s buried under even more mindless quests in a repetitive RPG that really didn’t need more of them. The cool new atomic powers, amusing dialogue from the narrator, and excellent final boss are highlights, but are barely enough to make the rest of this return to Maneater’s seas worth your while.                            
60	                                Maneater: Truth Quest is an enjoyable but unessential expansion for Maneater. Westhaven is an entertaining narrator but his over the top conspiracy theories just aren’t as entertaining as his documentary narration in the base game. The new missions end up falling into the same type of repetition the other missions. The new atomic shark powers are actually one of the better parts of the expansion and having a green nuclear energy ball fly from a tail whip attack was a great addition. While taking on the new sea life monstrosities provided an enjoyable challenge, Truth Quest is a necessary reason to return to the water for only the most devoted Maneater fans.                            
60	                                Players who loved Maneater will surely find more to appreciate in Truth Quest, but it doesn't do enough to truly expand on what made Maneater so memorable in the first place. The DLC is an obvious choice for those who simply want more of the world of the base game, but anyone looking for some major leaps in either the gameplay loop or its iterations will be left a little wanting.                            
94	                                Arguably the best Far Cry to date, Far Cry 6 maximizes PS5 capability while delivering a terrific experience. New and old Far Cry players shouldn't miss this one.                            
91	                                The island of Yara, where Far Cry 6 takes place, feels truly alive. We enjoyed "making the revolution" and fighting one of the best villains in the saga, Anton Castillo. But what we like the most about this "sandbox" is that you could simply go for a walk through Esperanza streets, the jungle or the beaches and find incredibly fun situations.                            
90	                                Far Cry 6 isn’t perfect but the anger toward the FC formula or the size of the game seems unnecessary. It’s fun, it’s beautiful and it’s finished without any massive bugs or glitches. So, grab your favorite amigo and your killer backpack and let’s start a revolution, baby!                            
90	                                Far Cry 6 is exactly what you'd expect from a Far Cry game. It's big, open and full of things to do but there's a lot of fun to be had and some excellent combat to enjoy.                            
90	                                Far Cry 6 is an outstanding game because it has a great design of mechanics and missions, its setting is authentic even with localization flaws, and the game does not drag on too long or become repetitive; on the contrary, just walking around the island and exploring the public and hidden routes is a satisfying activity.                            
90	                                Far Cry 6 strikes me as the apex of the series, mechanically, structurally, and narratively. Far Cry has gone through its fair share of growing pains since Far Cry 3 became the de facto standard. Yet all roads, rocky or otherwise, have led to this point. Crazed villains, bombastic mayhem, and open freedom have been polished to their highest sheen. What’s presented is a dramatic piece of open world escapism, rife with possibility. Players can become decorated contract killers, loosing the bonds of an oppressive regime with any amount of chaotic bloodshed, engage in aimless side quests, or paint the world red with friends. The massive scope of Yara provides a playground of opportunity for engagement, transforming Far Cry 6 into the best yet, a date with destruction.                            
90	                                This Far Cry is the best since the third opus - generous, fun to play, with beautiful writing and novelties, including the handcrafted weapons and the Supremos that make the gameplay extremely enjoyable. The atmosphere is perfect for an exotic journey that offers mystery, a good dose of madness and action. Plus with top notch casting. True pure Far Cry as we like it.                            
90	                                A huge, exciting world packed with entertaining content against the backdrop of a mostly-accomplished story of charismatic revolutionaries makes this a return to fine form for the franchise. Ubisoft has married inspired design with trademark gameplay to great effect. This is the best Far Cry yet.                            
90	                                Far Cry 6 is a massive game, with plenty to do and see. It features a gripping story and combat that plays like a dream. I had so much fun doing everything I possibly could, and I'll be diving back in to finish off all the side content.                            
85	                                Far Cry 6 is a huge game, full of content and activities, stories to live and places to discover. Joining the revolution is not a flawless journey, but still an exciting one. If you loved the previous game, then it is worthwhile to start packing the most capacious bags you have and reach Yara!                            
85	                                While it may not wholly evolve the franchise in a radically new way, Far Cry 6 smooths out many of the wrinkles and growing pains previous Far Cry games have had, while building on a foundation that’s largely worked for the series since 2012’s Far Cry 3. Far Cry 6 strikes a great tonal balance, a variety of activities and exploration that never get dull, another imposing villain whose presence can be felt throughout, and a brilliant main character. Yara is a fun playground because it’s Dani’s playground, and that’s a crucial part of the equation, part of the meaningful growth the latest entry brings to the Far Cry franchise. ¡Viva la Revolución!                            
85	                                If this isn’t your first foray into the series, then Far Cry 6 may leave you feeling a little exhausted. But if you’ve never played a Far Cry game before, you are in for the ride of your life.                            
85	                                Far Cry 6 is the most fun I've had in a Far Cry game for years, but it won't be for everyone. If you've grown tired of the gameplay loops of the Far Cry titles of recent times, Far Cry 6 doesn't make much of an effort to change that up. However,  if the thrill of carnage and combat still appeals, it's crazy, chaotic, and an absolute blast.                            
85	                                Far Cry 6 brings us back to the playground as you're encouraged to enjoy this game however you want. Those here for the story will witness some brilliant performances from the cast that weaves in the guerrilla approach to combat and overthrowing a dictator. On the other hand, this is one of the most diverse in-game environments that I have seen from the developer, with plenty of high action and optional means of losing yourself in this intense experience.                            
85	                                At its core, Far Cry 6 both shines and suffers from many of the same strengths and weaknesses that have characterized the last few entries in the franchise. On one hand, it has incredibly engaging action and an open world begging to be used creatively. On the other, it has repetitive and sometimes rote mission design, with disconcerting tonal shifts that seat inconceivable brutality and violence at the same table with silly, absurd humor that feels at best disrespectful, and at worst, wildly inappropriate. What finally elevates Far Cry 6 is a better-than-average cast, and a more comprehensible and grounded story that is set in one of the most lavish and beautiful environments ever created for a game. It’s fascinating, flawed, and full of contradictions. It’s a Far Cry game.                            
83	                                As fun as it is, the gameplay core is the same, but introduces adjustments and a new progression system. Great world and nice use of the jet packs. However, the AI still lacks of consistency.                            
80	                                The best entry in the series so far, cursed with uneven storytelling and rare yetunmissable technical issues. Despite these flaws, Yara is well worth a visit. [Issue#7, p.70]                            
80	                                We will be honest with you : by launching Far Cry 6, we came with a negative opinion. It's true that since the Primal episode, the series has declined over the years, with a New Dawn spin-off completely missing its pumps. But it seems that Omar Bouali and his team at Ubisoft Toronto did not want to be responsible for the downfall of the saga. Result : Far Cry 6 surprises and amazes on many aspects; starting with its story, much more interesting than any that we have lived since the beginning of the series.                            
80	                                How do you stop a cruel South American dictator who cares nothing for his people and only craves to become even richer and more powerful? With some good will, inventiveness and perseverance, if Far Cry 6 is to be believed. And with the help of a crazy rooster. ¡Viva la revolución!                            
80	                                The story can be a bit confusing, as is the structure of how it's played out, but this doesn't detract from the fact that this is probably the most fun I've had with a Ubisoft game and a Far Cry game in particular.                            
80	                                Familiar, entertaining and with a cast of wacky characters, Far Cry 6 is a lot of fun. It is not novel, new or groundbreaking in any way but we are here to play Far Cry after all, and Far Cry 6 is certainly that. With lots to do and discover, Yara is a great playground to cause destruction and carnage. The customization is much improved from previous games as is the crafting, and if you liked Far Cry before, then this should be right up your street.                            
80	                                Marks a new era for the Far Cry series and delivers more explosive action and adventure than ever before, even as the story fumbles some of its more upsetting plot points.                            
80	                                We end up with a very efficient production, reconnecting with the exotic atmosphere specific to the saga and supported by some commendable efforts in terms of storytelling. Solid Far Cry, no doubt.                             
80	                                The world is fun to explore, filled with a batch of great side activities, and never once compromises the story’s pacing. The gameplay is smooth and responsive, though the AI needs fine-tuning to be more consistent. It’s all wrapped up in a beautiful presentation that truly transports players to paradise, at least when nothing terrible is happening. That’s not to say the game doesn’t have its quirks and questionable decisions, and many of its core gameplay loops contradict themselves when a setpiece moment shows up, but there’s still a lot of good to be found here. Yara may be an awful place to live, but playing Far Cry 6 is well worth the trip to the rotten paradise.                            
80	                                After 40 hours in, I’m still eager to hop back in, venturing further off the beaten path, clearing out any lingering FND Bases and checking out the Insurgency post-game content to grind out additional weapons and rewards. With a solid story, an engaging cast of characters, and a plethora of enthralling side content, Far Cry 6 is an easy recommendation for FPS fans.                            
80	                                Far Cry 6 is a game that understands the importance of fighting back against fascism and taking a stand as part of your own personal revolution, yet it’s often held back by gameplay that wants to distance itself from that idea as you fawn over cute puppies and fire off outlandish grenade launchers. Yet it’s still a start, and a bold step forward for a company that has long sat on the fence of political discussion. If you’re after more Far Cry, this delivers and pushes the formula forward into exciting new territory.                            
80	                                Far Cry 6 is a must-play experience for fans of Ubisoft’s flagship first-person shooter series. New features, such as the Supremo and various ammo types, do a great job of spicing up a familiar formula. At the same time, the series' rock-solid gunplay and exciting exploration are more inviting than ever. Even though it sometimes stumbles, both in terms of performance and tone, traversing the island nation of Yara is so fun that you probably won’t care all that much…Whether smashing the system solo or teaming up with a fellow freedom fighter for some online co-op, Far Cry 6 is sure to give armchair guerillas something worth fighting for. Viva La Revolución!                            
80	                                Colourful and brutal, funny and horrifying, Far Cry 6 is the distilled essence of its franchise, as well as a richer and more coherent experience than recent outings.                             
80	                                Far Cry 6 tries to be something new but falls short on all ideas. The Supremo backpack and the design of Yara are on point, but you will be playing the same game you’ve been playing for years now when you scratch beneath the skin of this one. If you love the Far Cry series, you will love 6, but don’t expect anything new or revolutionary during your gameplay.                            
78	                                Far Cry 6 is an entertaining shooter, but it offers too much coolness instead of the necessary depth.                            
78	                                Vast and long-lived, Far Cry 6 is an open world where quantity is king: there are lots of playful ideas, and lots of customization possibilities, but often one gets the impression that Ubisoft tries at all costs to never end the battle of the guerrillas, even sacrificing the refinement of the game mechanics on the altar of accumulation. Far Cry 6 is therefore a fluctuating production: moments of high narrative involvement are accompanied by others of stasis, while the gameplay oscillates between good ideas and some uncertainty in the shooting phases and in artificial intelligence. It amuses and entertains, yet it does not overwhelm, nor exalt. It remains true that at times it still manages to make us perceive the penetrating smell of the revolution, one that smells of blood, tobacco and freedom.                             
78	                                Far Cry 6 introduces some interesting new elements, with a talking protagonist and some solid supporting characters, but unfortunately the villain nicely portrayed by Giancarlo Esposito appears too stereotyped to stand out and the structure with its regions and lieutenants turns out to be too traditional. Gameplay-wise the game is a mixed bag, with some good things but also several missed opportunities.                            
75	                                The 6th installment in the Far Cry series has nothing very new to say, as it continues to build on a successful formula that keeps the fans happy and willing to come back for more. Exciting gunplay, just enough content spread across a huge map and a standard Far Cry core gameplay seem enough to overtake most of the shortcomings and keep the fans busy for yet another year.                            
75	                                If Far Cry 3 was the last game you really got into, or the modern Far Cry formula is your meaty open-world experience of choice that somehow never loses its potency, you’ll find a lot of comfort in Far Cry 6. Otherwise, get to it when you get to it, and try not to burn out.                            
75	                                Once more, Ubisoft delivers more of the same in a new setting. It’s worth playing, thanks to the enjoyable firefights Far Cry is known for. Also the new tyrant played by Giancarlo Espansito makes a good impression in a diverse and nice new environment called Yara. The sixth installment of the series has some problems, however; dumb enemy AI, the absence of a skilltree and a general lack of polish being the most annoying ones.                            
70	                                Far Cry 6 makes some meaningful narrative improvements, helped by a fantastic performance by Esposito. However, repetitive and familiar gameplay, combined with a restrictive progression system, means changes are needed in the future if Ubisoft wants the series to continue.                            
70	                                Far Cry 6 is fun, there’s no doubt about that. Yara is a fantastic backdrop, and if you enjoy mindlessly shooting stuff up, you’ll absolutely be in your element. You probably won’t really care much for Dani’s story though, and the game’s tonal dissonance can be somewhat off-putting. But lean into the mayhem and you’ll have a good enough time, even if you don’t remember much about it once you’ve turned the game off.                            
70	                                Far Cry 6 feels like a sequel that was made because there needed to be a sequel, that's making changes because it needs to show progress. The previous three numbered games in the series felt like they had their own identity and tried to offer more and more options to the player, but Far Cry 6 is a lateral move towards something that isn't quite the Far Cry I originally loved.                            
70	                                Far Cry 6 is the best version of Ubisoft's open world formula to date, but whether that's still a selling point to you is up for debate. The few advancements and new mechanics won't be enough to convince those burnt out to return for one more exotic trip, but if you're down for another lengthy checklist to complete, then the series has never been better. It's another healthy serving of comfort food; one that sticks to what it knows best while slightly iterating positively.                            
70	                                Whoever fell in love with Far Cry 5 (and especially New Dawn) will fall in love with Far Cry 6. The game offers more of the same - dozens of hours of pure run'n'gun fun in a giant open-world that will last for months. If you want to relax after a hard day, get the game. If you want anything more, stay away from it.                            
70	                                Far Cry 6 is an attempt to use all the best gameplay ideas Ubisoft ever had. Sometimes it works, and sometimes it doesn't, leaving you with some mixed feelings.                            
70	                                Far Cry 6 is a good opus in the series, but it doesn't bring anything new to the IP besides a good performance from Giancarlo Esposito.                             
70	                                A truly huge game that adds more and more content without really fundamentally changing anything. It’s not a very good shooter but it will successfully distract you with countless relatively fun activities.                            
70	                                Far Cry 6 is a good addition to the beloved shooter franchise thanks to great gunplay and stunning visuals. It's a shame however that there are some really annoying bugs, crashes, and quality of life issues that take you out of the experience. The story is so much fun when Esposito's on-screen, which is, unfortunately, not enough.                            
70	                                Far Cry 6 feels like the franchise is begging for its "Assassin's Creed Origins" moment, where its underlying core systems are tweaked and overhauled. It still offers plenty of fun and carnage, but the formula has begun to wear thin…After three mainline entries with almost exactly the same structure, along with numerous spinoffs and expansions that hit the same notes, it’s definitely time for the series to either take an extended break or move on in a new direction.                            
65	                                If all you’re after is a lot of shooting and exploding and collecting set within a stunning tropical milieu, you’ll find it here. Have at it. If, on the other hand, you’d like a little more in the way of innovative play and nuanced commentary, best keep hunting.                            
65	                                Unfortunately, Far Cry 6 has missed the mark again, with too few significant improvements and a lot of bloat. For those who love Far Cry, it’s yet another game to blast through and add to the pile, but compared to the competition, this series is starting to fall seriously behind.                            
60	                                Far Cry 6 is on firmer ground when it’s squarely focused on the revolution, even if that exposes how little the game seeks to shake up the series’s formula.                             
60	                                Reflecting on the nature of revolutionary uprising he comes to the conclusion that everything is ultimately ok as long as you die smiling. Similarly, if that’s all you really want from an open world shooter then Far Cry 6 will not disappoint.                              
60	                                Far Cry 6 calls for an urgent change in the series. I'm not sure how much time Far Cry can continue down this path. Patience has already run out: the current approach is tiresome and the next game in the series needs to be a radical change in the way of making an open world, first-person shooter.                            
60	                                Whoever had experience with any of the main Far Cry games since Far Cry 3 and afterwards will know exactly what to expect from here. Same forts to conquer, same guns to use, same abilities to utilize, same quest design, same everything albeit in the setting of Yara (read "fictionalized Cuba").                            
50	                                An exercise in banality, despite its vibrant landscapes and characters. But then perhaps, given their parallels with Cuban History, even they ultimately make it worse. [Issue#365, p.102]                            
50	                                As it happens, though I played for much longer, I had had more than my fill after the first four hours, with no desire to venture back in. Strange to tell, I mourn the very things—the scalable vantages, the unlockable skills—that Ubisoft has left behind for the sake of freshness.                            
50	                                Far Cry 6 does little to innovate and bring the series forward in a new and exciting direction, despite the beautiful island of Yara and the decent gunplay.                            
40	                                If you’re interested in another Far Cry game that does the Far Cry stuff the way it’s been doing it for 10 years, you’ll probably have a good time, but if you’ve already hit your limit with this kind of game, Far Cry 6 is the ne plus ultra of why open-world game design is so badly in need of a revolution.                            
90	                                Rogue Lords is an charming and addictive roguelike that let you teach from every death to get better and go further. Great mechanisms and low frustration, despite the die & retry approach.                            
87	                                Rogue Lords borrows quite a bit from other popular games, but it isn't really worse for wear because of it. Players looking for something completely fresh may be disappointed by the strong similarities with games like Slay the Spire and Darkest Dungeon, but the unique visual design and combat twists push this sternly into the "more of a good thing isn't a bad thing" category for me. If you like roguelikes and turn-based squad combat, this is the perfect game to spend some time with as we enter the early days of the Halloween season.                            
80	                                Rogue Lords is an innovative mix of roguelike and RPG elements with clever new concepts to tax your tactical mind. There’s a constant one-more-encounter compulsivity as you look to make your band of villains ever more powerful, and a huge scope for creativity provided by the reality-bending devil mode. For an entertainingly strategic experience where you have free license to indulge your dark side and wreak havoc with a variety of ghosts and ghouls, Rogue Lords will sate your wicked desires.                            
80	                                Rogue Lords is an extremely fun spin on the roguelike genre, featuring addictive Devil Power design, thoughtful gameplay, a variety of choices and a highly enjoyable atmosphere. However, as always, the Devil is in the details: the game's RNG-based nature, repetitiveness and lack of balance can spoil the otherwise good impression.                            
78	                                Rogue Lords’ approach to turn-based combat — with or without cards — isn’t radically different, but the Devil Mode and ability to “cheat your way to victory” offers a new mechanic that will have you rethinking your usual strategies. Some issues with bugs, balancing, and its overlong, weariness-inducing campaigns are made less egregious thanks to its amusing writing, great music and fantastic gothic horror art direction. Unlike some of the games in this style, Rogue Lords demands a bit of patience, thought and tolerance for complexity while still be accessible to fans of the genre.                            
77	                                Rogue Lords is a well-built roguelike that can get anyone in an evil Halloween party mood. The game has the style and addictive hook to keep devilish map-crawlers progressing through suspicious sanctuaries and nasty taverns. Lovers of the genre will find a familiar but engaging gameplay loop and new strategies to learn. However, its reliance on punishing difficulty, probably meant to encourage more risk-taking, can take a toll on the player's overall enjoyment of what is a really fun game.                            
75	                                The necessary mastery requires showing patience and perseverance, further reducing the accessibility of a title which, for all that and despite the implementation of actions that are sometimes difficult to define, remains particularly well designed, surprising and satisfying to go through.                            
75	                                Rogue Lords will not suit everyone, that's for sure. Very (too?) difficult at times and what you will get during each of your runs, this game will at least have the merit of making you feel a strong sense of accomplishment at each boss you defeat. On our side, as rogue-lite fans, we were clearly won over. The art direction is a bit of a head-turner, like Darkest Dungeon for example, and should appeal to the same type of players.                            
70	                                With Halloween season at the doors already, Rogue Lords can offer some nice time in the company of ghouls, zombies and vampires. The battles will be tough for sure, but don't fret because Devil will always play by his own rules.                            
70	                                Rogue Lords is a fine lead-up to the spooky season, with a genuinely addictive gameplay loop and a satisfying combat system. The ability to mess with the game’s own mechanics as the Devil is an absolutely inspired idea, and the experience is only made less than perfect by a few glitches that need patching out. The game would feel a little more complete if there were more to do in each chapter’s overworld, but what is there is a delightfully challenging roguelike. The inability to lower the difficulty may turn some people away, but other people will relish the challenge.                            
65	                                While charming in its use of gothic horror themes and tropes, Rogue Lords barely does enough to stand out from previous turn-based dungeon crawlers.                            
60	                                Rogue Lords needs a lot more polish before I could feel comfortable recommending it. The UI's messy, the pacing is off, and it makes itself hard to get into, with overcomplicated mechanics presented in obscure, difficult-to-interpret ways. I like its atmosphere and the glee it takes in letting you be evil, but if I wasn't reviewing it, I probably would've dropped Rogue Lords after the first hour. There's fun to be had here if you can push through it, but like a lot of Eurojank games, it doesn't feel like it's entirely finished.                            
50	                                The terror and hindrance effects make each run feel uniquely challenging, and the story events and Disciple traits are where Rogue Lords really shines. Unfortunately, as it stands, Rogue Lords suffers significantly from its lack of balance and the repetitive nature of both runs and combat. It can be difficult to strategize when RNG constantly feels stacked against the player, and being forced to restart a book after a surprise, impossible boss fight is demoralizing. With some retuning, however, Rogue Lords could better capitalize on its great ideas and innovate for the roguelike genre.                            
45	                                Rogue Lords is a fine game with some novel systems for lovers of roguelites to play around with, but it will not grab your attention long enough to keep you coming back. Given its premise and stellar art design, that’s a shame.                            
90	                                Vaas: Insanity is an excellent first DLC for Far Cry 6. The look into the chaos of Vaas’ mind is a really interesting one, and the gameplay loop is as intriguing as it is challenging. It can be fun solo or with friends, and is absolutely worth taking the time to check out.                            
90	                                Far Cry 6 Vaas: Insanity sees Ubisoft tackle the roguelike genre, allowing players to play as the iconic villain in a great expansion.                            
80	                                This is a great starting point to the trio of DLCs Far Cry 6 is about to get. While Far Cry 6 focused on improving on an old format, Far Cry 3 managed to give us something refreshing.                            
80	                                Quotation forthcoming.                            
80	                                Rather than continuing the story of guerillas in Yara, Far Cry 6 Vaas: Insanity offers a tight little roguelite centered on the villain of Far Cry 3. Stripping the franchise down to its core of exploration and shooting, this DLC could stand alone as its own small but satisfying game.                            
75	                                We must recognize the first great DLC of Far Cry 6 the effort to offer something different, and from the eyes of one of its most remembered villains. The roguelite mechanics fit well, although it may not appeal to everyone due to the repetition and difficulty. Its small world and little variety of situations make it feel like a missed opportunity.                             
75	                                Far Cry 6 Vaas: Insanity provides a deeper and more nuanced look at a troubled character. Unfortunately, it has a fairly restrictive rogue-lite system if you're pressed for time. Worse, there's not a lot to look forward to after your initial clear.                            
70	                                The roguelite experiment is appreciable because it offers a demanding and satisfying challenge. Unfortunately, the lack of general variety and the poor in-depth narrative component are two significant burdens, and they are not the only ones.                            
67	                                Given the redundancy of activities and the lack of variety of situations, Insanity will offer a good amount of hours of play only to those who will be moved by the desire to improve their records or to those players dedicated to completism. All the others will find themselves in front of a more compelling experience on the artistic side than on the strictly playful one. Anyone who has experienced Jason's epic in Far Cry 3, however, will certainly have an added incentive to explore Vaas' insane mind.                             
60	                                At the very least, Vaas: Insanity succeeds more than Far Cry 6 proper at moving the franchise forward. By the same token, sanding off the hard edges of a character conceived in a much different world could sever the last few connections to Far Cry's glorious past. The DLC's roguelike structure feels novel but incomplete, another ultimately unsuccessful attempt at mixing things up after Far Cry: New Dawn's RPG elements and Far Cry 5's DLC adventures into new genres. If Ubisoft can do a better job of recapturing the spirit of its other two antagonists in the rest of Far Cry 6's season pass (or in the recently rumored Vaas film project) franchise fans may finally have something to celebrate in 2021.                            
86	                                Disciples is back with a very interesting and lengthy campaign and addictive turn-based battles. A clear recommendation if you are interested in this genre.                            
80	                                Disciples: Liberation is a fantastic experience. From the engaging story to the deep but approachable Strategy RPG combat, this is the type of game to suck players in until the wee hours of the morning. There aren't many games like Disciples: Liberation on the market these days, especially when the old champion, Might and Magic, has become an autobattler. Disciples: Liberation a welcome breath of fresh air that delivers hope for the future of the Strategy RPG genre.                            
75	                                Disciples: Liberation is a unique combination of turn-based strategy and real-time RPG. The game features interesting gameplay hooks that could redefine the genre in long-term perspective.                            
75	                                A world-spanning epic with a meaty, varied and satisfying strategy battle system. While it takes a while for the steam engine that is Discples: Liberation to pick up speed, once it’s off, the journey is well worth taking.                            
71	                                A lot of content, yet too easy for pros. Disciples enthusiasts betterprepare for some adjustments.                            
70	                                Disciples: Liberation is a vast turn-based/ RPG/ city management hybrid that would have been great if some aspects of the game were trimmed down. The core ideas behind the gameplay are implemented well. Skills, units, battle mechanics, dialog choices are classy. On the other hand, the writing is juvenile and the low level of challenge can make the game feel tedious.                            
70	                                Disciples: Liberation takes us on an epic adventure through a Dark Fantasy world that is filled with conflict and pain. The compelling narrative, characters and the tough decisions you have to make again and again to balance your standing in the four factions are what drives this game forward. The gameplay alone wouldn’t be able to motivate us for the 80 hour adventure, it is just to simple. The combat rarely presents a challenge and with the abundance of resources loses are easily replaced. We still had a lot of fun, since the roleplay aspect of the game works well enough.                            
70	                                Disciples: Liberation is a promising RPG with rich stories and compelling tactical combat, but nothing quite makes it a must-play.                            
68	                                Good writing but the rest is sub-par. In particular, the tiny size of combat arenas makes any attempt of strategizing utterly irrelevant.                            
60	                                An overly simplified simplification that winks at the audience of casual players displeasing the old ones is at the same time the cross and the delight of the new chapter of Disciples. Other than this, the "role-playing" developments of the plot could have been more effective.                            
80	                                WRC 10 is still the best rally simulator out there; despite stalling a few times on the way to the finish line. It’s clear that there’s real passion behind much of what KT Racing have poured into their final iteration of the franchise. But unfortunately, the half-baked 50th-anniversary mode and missteps with the mind-numbing career mode, distract from the overall experience. WRC 10 shines when it’s not trying to lure you in with a load of flashy bullshit. Instead, it’s best when it’s got you on the track, careering through chicanes or clinging on for dear life as you hoist yourself through a hairpin.                            
80	                                It's a big yes and a very beautiful candle blown out by Kylotonn. If it does not upset the regulars, WRC 10 manages to advance all of its game modes with small nice touches, such as tire allocation management, new career roles or the livery editor. . Anniversary Mode galvanizes content and lifespan via new, delightfully old-school layouts, to make the title the most complete in the license. We take real pleasure in terms of racing sensations and a total change of scenery on some specials, despite the recurring lack of staging and some technical flaws (tearing, cliping ...). But that is not the important thing: WRC 10 ends a decade at the top of the slope masterfully climbed by Kylotonn in recent seasons, and we hope that the French studio will succeed in closing its commitment to the world rally championship in the best possible way next season.                             
80	                                Here and now, we have another very solid rally simulator that should be considered as a valid option for every enthusiast of this form of racing, who prefers having fun on gravel to extreme, punishing realism. And that's not a sentence you could hear just three years ago. So, will I remember Nacon’s and KT Racing’s WRC with nostalgy? I sure will. Even if I was cursing the publisher’s DLC policy so many times.                            
79	                                WRC 10 is a melancholic better version of WRC 9, with some peculiar and welcome refinements to the physics and handling. Apart from that WRC 10 is a rock solid rally driving experience with some technical hiccups and an interesting, but somehow shallow, scenario mode.                            
72	                                WRC 10 is a decent rally experience, thanks to the solid driving model and improved vehicle feedback. The new tracks are good but team management has regressed and other changes are a mixed bag in what is a predictable yearly release.                            
70	                                WRC 10's precise controls and detailed graphics wonderfully replicate rally racing, though graphical hiccups occasionally sour the experience.                            
70	                                WRC 10 is the best the WRC series has ever been. It might not be the biggest leap in improvements, but the refinement of the vehicle control, the improved physics, new tweaks to the career – just as time-consuming as last year’s – and the increased legendary car/track count help make the return to the series a good one. There is just a bit too much deja vu here that might put off casual fans from buying the game if they already have WRC 9. Sadly, that is one of the downsides that come with these yearly sports releases. Still, I can recommend WRC 10 to the people who want a new racing game, and those who are into motorsports will find WRC 10 a great title to play with, just make sure you try to go for the full wheel set up to truly experience throwing a car around these amazingly designed courses.                            
70	                                WRC 10 is not a bad installment in the series, with its fair share of welcome novelties. The 50th anniversary mode finally allows you to take advantage of the discipline's old glories, and while we would have liked it to have been more fleshed out, it still makes an act of presence. The stable manager mode is also welcome, although it is still not understood why you have to end the previously mentioned mode in order to be able to access it. Undoubtedly the most striking feature is of course the arrival of the choice of tire allocation for the rally, which adds a good layer of strategy in certain events including the Monte-Carlo. Unfortunately, we feel that COVID has had its work, whether it is the proposed rallies that are no longer really in line with the 2021 calendar, more technical aspects of the game that have not changed a bit. Do not forget either that the license will change creamery in 2023, from KT Racing / Nacon to Codemasters / EA. This WRC 10 is therefore the penultimate opus of the French studio which will still have had the merit of bringing the series out of the mediocrity in which it stagnated, during the time when Milestone was in charge (the Metacritic ratings are from 80% on average during the Evolution Studios era to 60% during the Milestone era)                             
70	                                WRC 10 could be a simple DLC for the previous game of the series, but the developers chose to make an entire new software with just some small changes and a few new features including next-gen support.                            
70	                                WRC 10 is an extremely fun game with a few caveats around the amount of changed content from last year's entry. It's not a must-buy for those who own WRC 9 unless they are a rally fan desperate for the new stages for the 2021 season or the updated liveries, as the anniversary additions are the only major update from last year. However, whose who don't own WRC 9 but who are interested in rally racing will see this as the most comprehensive official WRC game to date, with lots to enjoy and plenty of hours' worth of entertainment to be found across its various modes.                            
70	                                Even in its most tepid of opportune changes, WRC 10 still finds ways to vex and test in ways that are both punishing but enjoyable to see through. Perhaps the biggest complaint you can utter about this year’s release is its surprising lack of indulging in the time periods it’s aiming to evoke, through its call-backs and roster inclusions alike.                             
70	                                WRC 10 FIA World Rally Championship is a solid all-around experience built on a reliable foundation. Rally fans will find no shortage of things to do across the mountain of content included on Day 1 (plus new cars and rallies planned for post-launch release). If you are new to all of this, the package is very compelling, but most of it will be old news for those who spent any amount of time in WRC8 or WRC 9. While it's more than the cliched roster update and higher number in the title, the criticism carries some validity.                            
65	                                The fact remains that it is once again one of those titles that once bought can easily remain installed all year round and that can be an excellent choice to be interspersed with other video games in those days when you wake up with a little of nostalgia for drifting in the mud of Chile or for the breathtaking jumps of the Rally of Finland for a bit of unpretentious fun even for those who do not have a cutting-edge driving position but want to have fun even only with the pad which, incidentally, performs quite well despite the Dualsense functions being only half exploited.                             
80	                                SkateBIRD is a beautiful and heartwarming game, and it’s something that will stay with me for years to come.                            
80	                                Through a great soundtrack and entertaining story beats, SkateBIRD proves that you don’t need to always look to the skies for a game to leave a lasting impression.                            
75	                                Skatebird is a charming but flawed game. The cute characters and strong environments are coupled with a camera system that acts haywire anytime you're near an object. The forgiving respawn system becomes brutal when you return to a spot where you're near an object that is difficult to navigate around. The sometimes-dodgy collision detection can make some quests go on longer than they should. It's still a game worth checking out, but here's hoping that some patches can elevate it into something special.                            
75	                                SkateBIRD is a wonderful skateboarding game that plays familiar to THPS, but is as much its own game to separate the two.                            
70	                                SkateBIRD is an adorable action sports game with a lot of charm and funky beats. Setting aside minor control and camera issues, the unique perspective of being a teeny bird helps bring a refreshing look to the skate game genre. From dirty cereal bowls to server cables, travelling across 5 different levels to help your human come home was enjoyable and engaging. Meeting several interesting and pun-filled birds who help you on your journey just added to the quirk and charm. Glass Bottom Games has done a commendable job making this accessible for all gamers, allowing for a unique player experience.                            
65	                                Crazy and unique, Skatebird is far from perfect but you should give it a shot.                            
60	                                SkateBIRD offers cute birds and chill vibes in a neat package, but inconsistent and, at times, frustrating mechanics, as well as a lack of polish, makes it difficult to really enjoy the strong audiovisual elements it brings to the table.                            
60	                                SkateBIRD is a charming game with fun writing and a great soundtrack, but can’t strike a good balance between offering precision boarding and silly physics chaos.                             
60	                                SkateBIRD is a serene and meditative experience but relies a little too heavily on nostalgia with its design while removing any real challenge. Controls hindered the opportunity to get more out of this experience, and I found my bird spent more time rolling on the ground than around on the skateboard. The mission, dialogue, and overall narrative were fun to uncover but isn’t there enough to sustain your interest after completion, essentially clipping the wings of replayability.                            
60	                                A decent skateboarding game with an entertaining theme and quirk. The physics and visuals imperfections hold it back for sure but there's still enough there to have a good few hours of fun.                            
60	                                It’s just overall not that well executed. The physics and gameplay are not where they should be. The levels are just okay. The goals are rarely entertaining. But you’re here for the birds, right? There are definitely skateboarding birds, I can guarantee they are in SkateBIRD. I’m not even being sarcastic, the birds are absolutely great. Just try to focus on that and nothing else.                            
60	                                I’m not going to say “buyer beware” in regards to the Switch version of Skatebird. By all means, if you have younger gamers or Switch is your primary gaming device, then playing Skatebird on Switch will probably be just fine for you. However, if you have the option, go with the PC version of the game, especially considering that the game is coming to Xbox Game Pass next month. Even though many of its tropes are a bit played out within the genre, Skatebird is a game that knows it’s silly, and embraces it in a way that makes it fun to play (on PC).                             
50	                                A chirpy spin on the skateboarding sim genre, undermined by poor level design and frustrating gameplay.                            
50	                                There a lot of elements of SkateBIRD that are great. The birds are fun, as is customizing them and finding more things with which to dress them up. Their little adventure is also fun, the soundtrack is excellent, and the levels are fun miniaturized takes on the normal skatepark fare. It’s just that there is so much dragging these charming elements down, the most noticeable of which is the actual skating and the physics involved with it. SkateBIRD might be fun to experience for its premise and cuteness, but those looking for a good technical skate game experience will likely find their expectations crashing and burning frequently, much like most of my sessions with it.                            
90	                                Lemnis Gate players will find that the hours disappear when they're playing it. It's addictive, impossible to put down, and could be the sleeper hit of the year if it finds its audience. And with Lemnis Gate available on Xbox Game Pass, it should have no problem doing just that.                            
80	                                Lemnis Gate is a very pleasant surprise. A unique, strategic mind-bending FPS, it is mechanically strong and content-rich. There are still some technical issues that need to be resolved and the progression system is very stingy, but what is here is a hidden gem.                            
80	                                Lemnis Gate is a revolutionary turn-based combat strategy FPS that takes place in a thrilling time loop.                            
80	                                Lemnis Gate brings a lot of innovation to the table, surpassing its time travel rival to present a strategic FPS that's well worth some attention. While held back by a lack of modes outside of online multiplayer and an outdated presentation, launching on the hugely successful Xbox Game Pass service makes the game palatable to those with an existing subscription. Whether it's jumping into an online lobby or gathering a group of friends for private matchmaking, there's nothing else quite like Lemnis Gate on console, and it's well worth a look for anyone who wants to see one possible future of the FPS genre.                            
80	                                Lemnis Gate is a clever and damn well-designed game. Emphasizing tactical choices over pure skill, this original turn-based shooter impresses. Its successful concept mixing FPS and time loops gives rise to refreshing clashes. Too bad some of its content neglects strategy in favor of less interesting direct confrontations. Hopefully his already sparse player base doesn't dwindle too quickly, as Lemnis Gate follows through on his excellent concept.                             
79	                                Of course, if you are someone who likes to keep an eye on new Game Pass entries, it doesn’t take much to see that Lemnis Gate is one of the recent Day One additions to the service, finding players, even with the cross-play option, is something that can take a bit of time but be patient and you’ll have a blast. The gameplay quality is definitely no reason for a lack of players, although it may be a sign of what’s to come with big triple-A shooters inbound.                            
60	                                Lemnis Gate firing on all cylinders can be a delightfully cerebral experience, its time loop concept and diverse character roster paving the way for some truly spectacular moment-to-moment gameplay. It’s just a pity then that at launch, the majority of the player base, at least outside of the higher ranks, seem unwilling to embrace the whacky concept. Given time, though, once a core of dedicated fans develops, Lemnis Gate has the potential to provide a truly novel alternative take on the hero shooter genre.                            
75	                                I do think that Maple Powered Games is on to something here with Monster Harvest. Its mishmash of systems accomplishes, for the most part, what they were trying to do – this is undeniable. Just be forewarned that under nearly every rock, and within the leaves of all those trees, there will sit a bug waiting to suck the entertainment out of it. And what you get out of Monster Harvest will vary depending on how willing you are to put up with that. Still, there’s a lot to enjoy here, and if you’re a fan of Stardew Valley or Pokemon, you owe it to yourself to check this one out.                            
74	                                Monster Harvest is retro in how it looks, which is great, but also in how it plays, which isn't as great. The gameplay doesn't feel addictive enough for a farming simulator, and the monster battle portion feels tacked on. I had fun with the game, but I never felt drawn into the world.                            
70	                                For all of its faults, Monster Harvest is still a unique experience that has the potential for a large payoff, if the team can rectify some of the problems. The premise is amazing, the execution is pretty great, and there are just a few more things to iron out before this title achieves legendary status. At this time, it's not a perfect game, but I can't stop playing it.                            
70	                                Monster Harvest is a good game that a little too closely resembles Stardew Valley and does not execute its Pokèmon-like mechanics cleanly or uniquely enough. Fortunately, it’s mostly visually beautiful with nice music and more than plenty to do.                            
60	                                The farming side of things is a little better than the RPG side of things, but there are so many games on the Switch that offer a more satisfying experience, it’s hard to recommend this one. Add in a bevy of bugs, and this lands firmly in the so-so bucket.                            
60	                                Monster Harvest is part of a growing genre that tries to combine farming sims like Harvest Moon with creature collecting like Pokemon. Unfortunately, by trying to cram as many different mechanics as possible into one tiny title, Monster Harvest pared them down to their basest level in an effort to offer a nibble of many things but never a filling feast. As for the bugs it launched with, those will soon be addressed with promised patches, but when it comes to gameplay, Monster Harvest still feels like it needs a little more time to grow. A lot more depth on all fronts will turn this garden variety game into a bumper crop; with enough time, I have faith the developers will find the balance Monster Harvest needs to achieve greatness.                            
50	                                Monster Harvest is a good example of why great ideas also need to be followed up with great execution. There’s nothing wrong with the idea of a farm sim with monster-catching elements, but Monster Harvest does a rough job of convincing you of that. The monster RPG content is so poorly done that it might as well have not been implemented at all, as it clearly took focus away from the decent farm sim portion of the gameplay. Amazingly, the farm sim gameplay still redeems this enough that it’s not a complete dumpster fire, but we’d only give this the barest of recommendations to anybody looking for another entry in the genre. Take our word for it, you’re much better off just starting over with a new farm in Stardew Valley, or picking up Rune Factory 4.                            
40	                                There’s a lot of potential to Monster Harvest, but it falls short on delivering a farming sim game that comes close to rivalling others in the genre. Hopefully, with time, Monster Harvest continues to grow, but until then it feels like it’s missing what makes the hard work worthwhile. Honestly, this feels like an Early Access title that still needs more time before it’s ready for full release. It seems the phrase ‘third time’s the charm’ does not apply to game delays.                            
30	                                I’d like to be able to say that aside from the bugs, Monster Harvest is a great game, but that’s just not true at this point. The game is just missing too many staples that other farming sims feature. There is little main story, no NPC interaction, a near featureless battle-system, no side quests, and barely any small intermediary goals throughout the game. Even beating the final boss is greeted with a single line of dialogue and zero fanfare. Publisher Merge Games has repeatedly claimed additional content will release when debugging is complete. It would be worth RPGamer’s time to wait for both of those events to occur.                            
95	                                Call of Duty: Vanguard may be the best CoD installment to date with stunning graphics that shine on the new systems and finely tuned, balanced gun play. They bring a new and fresh approach to the WWII and D-Day scenario making the solo campaign just as enjoyable as the multiplayer.                            
95	                                Call of Duty: Vanguard is a standout shooter experience. A globetrotting campaign that features some of the franchise’s best visuals features a core mystery that is over far too quickly but remains strong. I also wish the Zombies mode wasn’t impacted by a content drop that is expected a month from launch, meaning that players are given an engaging but sometimes toothless wave-based assault on the undead. Yet the multiplayer is an exceptional entry at the heart of Vanguard. It offers refinement on the standard set by Modern Warfare and gives players an incredible amount of challenges to complete to best show off their combat prowess. While a new Warzone map isn’t here yet, there’s plenty to look forward to in the months to come. Despite skipping a year, Sledgehammer Games is at its peak with Call of Duty: Vanguard, delivering a premium World War II shooter and an incredible Call of Duty game.                            
90	                                This is a good installment, but the stutter in combat makes me wonder if it’s as polished as it should be. The game has crashed on me sometimes during Blitz modes in particular, with a lot of players. But overall it held up tremendously well in multiplayer as I fought my way to the first Prestige level and got through it with a 0.84 kill/death ratio. In fact, the more I played the more I enjoyed multiplayer.                            
90	                                The stars have aligned for Call of Duty: Vanguard. For the first time, this truly feels like a full package without any caveats. Sure, some parts are naturally stronger than others but there isn’t a weak link in sight. After back to back triumphs, Call of Duty is now on a killstreak.                             
87	                                Even failing at "showing World Wart Two like never before", Call of Duty Vanguard is a great FPS. Campaign is full of epic (and some dramatic) moments, multiplayer is fun and fast, and includes 16 maps (twice as the previous Call of Duty game) with plenty of modes and progression elements, and the new zombies mode is incredibly fun.                            
85	                                Aside from breath-taking visuals, the campaign mode of Vanguard doesn’t have much to say, as it’s the standard short and sweet Call of Duty campaign that we’ve known for years, but when it comes to multiplayer Vanguard is a beast, offering the most content than any other COD game before with some top notch map design and super smooth gameplay.                            
85	                                Vanguard is an incremental iteration for the Call of Duty franchise. It’s a solid entry in the series that does well what Call of Duty does well, but it doesn’t stand-out as a landmark release. If you enjoy Call of Duty, haven’t played for a few years, or are new to franchise, then by all means jump in. The water’s fine.                             
85	                                As a complete package, from a Call of Duty developer that hasn’t yet established its own Modern Warfare or Black Ops sub-franchise, Vanguard feels like it could end up being Sledgehammer’s tentpole. Iconic characters, unique multiplayer and map design, and overall integration into the wider Call of Duty experience set the pace for not only the next year, but whatever comes next from Sledgehammer.                            
85	                                Sledgehammer Games is back after 4 years and they are coming back in great shape.Of course, the different multiplayer modes are still effective, but this year the single player campaign really makes the difference. It has more depth with interesting characters and a spectacular setting. We did not expect such a graphically beautiful game either.                            
85	                                Call of Duty: Vanguard brings us a great mixture of thrilling story campaign, fresh multiplayer modes and an innovative Zombie mode. It is a fantastic experience for fans of the series and the 1st person shooters as well.                            
84	                                Vanguard doesn’t stray too far away from the classic Call of Duty formula we have come to expect from the franchise over the past several years. In many ways, it’s a little more of the same. That said, Call of Duty: Vanguard is an incredibly robust package offering up tons of content for the buck. Zombies mode is far more enjoyable and varied, the single-player campaign is a visual stunner, and 20 MP maps at launch is nothing to sneeze at. If you have passed over Call of Duty over the last several years, it might be time to come back.                            
83	                                Call of Duty: Vanguard is another strong entry for the franchise. It offers a lackluster campaign, but makes up for it with a frenetic and fun multiplayer experience. It doesn't bring anything new to the table in the FPS genre, but many of its elements definitely feel like an evolution for the franchise.                             
80	                                Once reinforcements do come for Zombies, it will be hard to argue against Vanguard as one of the best and most complete Call of Duty titles in the last decade, potentially of the franchise's entire history. This is one of the rare times Call of Duty has seriously dug into its past, learned from it, and delivered a new and improved experience. Vanguard sets a high bar for Call of Duty as the franchise moves into the next generation.                            
80	                                Even with a lacklustre Zombies experience, Call of Duty: Vanguard is Sledgehammer Games’ best Call of Duty to date. The studio is finally hitting its stride in getting its vision of the series to where it should be. The campaign is a rip-roaring five hours of fascinating character stories mixed with memorable locales, while the new additions to the admittedly by-the-numbers multiplayer are more than welcome. While it may not change the formula in any meaningful way, what you’ve got here is a great Call of Duty game.                            
80	                                Call of Duty: Vanguard's campaign is meaty, the Battle Pass will keep you going a while, and Zombies is wonderfully addictive.                            
80	                                Whilst Call of Duty Vanguard does not innovate much to push the boundaries of the franchise further, The WWII shooter does deliver a compelling experience. The short, but action-packed single-player offers a nice introduction, although it could be a bit more coherent. The zombies' mode offers some new elements, while still feeling trusted. But by far the biggest reason to like Vanguard is multiplayer. With a nice selection of maps, plenty of modes, and some tweaks to the known formula, it truly delivers.                            
80	                                Offering a trilogy of solid content offerings with campaign, multiplayer and zombies, Call of Duty: Vanguard is a valiant attempt from Sledgehammer which maybe plays it a little too safe in the end. Despite the messy, disjointed design choices for online, Vanguard still proves to be a satisfying experience. It may not lead the line of CoD entries as its name suggests, but it nestles nicely in the middle of the pack.                             
80	                                Call of Duty: Vanguard is certainly a good return to World War II by Sledgehammer, especially in terms of multiplayer modes: many maps, customizable weapons with numerous options and a progression system to applause. On the other hand, the single player campaign is just enough, far from being considered epic, while the Zombies mode needs to be expanded as soon as possible.                            
80	                                Iterating on what Call of Duty diehards know and love, Vanguard has the potential to stand up alongside some of the series' best. Whether it be a bombastic, action-flick inspired campaign, endlessly addictive multiplayer or now-staple zombies mode, the game feels like comfort food. However, I remain doubtful that the game's new and updated modes will do enough to win over anyone that wasn't convinced with earlier iterations.                            
80	                                The frame rate appears anchored to 60 frames, without particular uncertainties, while the soundtrack signed by Bear McCreary boasts an excellent main theme and, in general, effectively accompanies the action.                            
80	                                A solid installment for the series with a satisfying story and great multiplayer balance.                            
80	                                Does Call of Duty: Vanguard advance the series in any meaningful way? Of course not, but that doesn’t stop it from being a fantastic package for Call of Duty fans, or a good entry point for those seeking a way in. The campaign here is brief but captivating, managing to make you feel for its band of heroes despite your short time with them. Zombies has some interesting twists that keep you on your toes. And multiplayer is more of the same but with tweaks that some will love and others will hate, as usual. All in all, this is one of the best Call of Duty releases to date, and we’d love to see more of Vanguard’s exploits in the future.                            
80	                                Quotation forthcoming.                            
80	                                Call of Duty Vanguard is a solid yet unremarkable entry in the long running franchise.  On a technical level it’s one of the most impressive games out there right now.  On a gameplay level it’s nothing you haven’t seen before.                             
80	                                Call of Duty Vanguard is a very good COD, more intimate and more human than previous episodes. The characters are at the center of the experience and we appreciate this more relaxed tone that offers something very cinematic with a classic and realistic gameplay that always works very well.  An episode of quality even if it lacks a bit of the spectacular.                            
80	                                Sledgehammer Games clearly had high ambitions when approaching their third solo Call of Duty project. Doubling down on World War II was a smart idea to help the studio carve out its own identity separate from Infinity Ward and Treyarch. While Call of Duty: Vanguard doesn’t break the mold, it does succeed on most fronts, delivering one of the better multiplayer experiences in years for the franchise and a simplified Zombies mode that lowers the barrier of entry for those intimidated by past iterations.                            
79	                                Vanguard builds on the three pillars that fans of Call of Duty have come to expect. The problem: While the multiplayer mode plays great, the campaign is visually and acoustically well staged, but overall it's only "very solid" due to the weak AI and a far too predictable and short story. The zombie mode, on the other hand, is more beginner-friendly than ever, but the bottom line is that it disappoints, especially long-time fans, with an abundance of missing features. Provided that upcoming content updates improve the situation, there is still hope that the developers will make zombie hunters happy in the long run.                            
78	                                Call of Duty: Vanguard is one of the most anticipated shooters of the year, a year in which Battlefield was knocking on the door. While they do not risk in its highlights, they reinforce a game system that works this time as a complement to Warzone but an incentive to the height, with an outstanding campaign and multiplayer mode but with a forgettable zombie mode that does not detract from the fun that has given me Vanguard in all the hours I've played.                            
78	                                Although a solid offering overall, one can’t help but feel that the series has taken a step backwards in terms of the content available as well as the era depicted.                            
75	                                Perhaps the softest launch in Activision Blizzard's historic FPS series, Call of Duty Vanguard shows that there's much potential for this year's entry to grow. However with the weakest Zombies mode in series history, a shortage of cosmetics and upgrades for anything save your primary loadout, and a Campaign that could've offered so much more, Vanguard is a tough sell if you're looking for anything than your next TDM fix at the moment.                            
75	                                Call of Duty Vanguard is a particular episode, a collage of experiences that do not all have the same inspiration and quality. There is a very effective but not very original PvP, a short and breathless campaign, a Zombie mode that is almost a reward, with the promise of progressively growing. Depending on your needs, then decide whether or not to approach this year's chapter: if you like the cooperative experience against hordes of undead, you will probably just need a little patience.                             
75	                                Call of Duty: Vanguard brings a surprisingly engaging campaign and some amazing graphics. While some character flashbacks are better than others, and the length is a bit disappointing, the campaign is nevertheless a fun jot through the theatres of WWII.                            
73	                                The campaign of Call of Duty: Vanguard tries to be heroic, but falls short and becomes predictable due to one-dimensional characters with poor development. Even when the multiplayer has interesting gameplay options, they are nothing to write home about. Finally, the zombie mode adds a lot of entertainment to the experience, but it's not enough for this installment to be a must-buy.                            
70	                                Call of Duty: Vanguard is As Expected: The Video Game. You get the polish, the excitement, the rush the series always delivers within the stylised World War 2 setting. This year, the single-player campaign is undoubtedly the standout action blockbuster, with the Multiplayer serving chaotic fun and Zombies mode failing to try something different. Pick it up if you’re already a fan.                            
70	                                Call of Duty: Vanguard brings some interesting improvements to the multiplayer mode and the gameplay is quick and deadly -a departure from last year’s Black Ops: Cold War. On the downside it makes you feel that you are playing a modern shooter and not a WWII one. The campaign looks great, although it doesn’t contain any memorable moments. Zombies mode is even more accessible to new players, but is in dire need of content.                            
70	                                Call of Duty: Vanguard has a solid and fun multiplayer mode as well as a jaw-dropping technical outfit. Too bad that the single player has not enjoyed the same care and presents itself as one of the least convincing experiences in the history of the brand.                            
70	                                Despite recurring flaws, Call of Duty Vanguard manages to be convincing with its interesting campaign and its rich multiplayer. The zombie mode should have been fully stuffed at launch though. Once more, perfection is not for this year, but the new Call of is still OK.                            
70	                                For those looking for more of the same, Call of Duty: Vanguard does exactly that. It’s the same, great-feeling FPS with a fresh lick of WWII paint complete with all of the weapons, locales and caveats that come with it. It’s not a revolutionary entry for the series, but it’s not a particularly poor one, either.                            
70	                                Its narrative is fractious and slight, compared to Sledgehammer’s previous work, but the chance for a chaotic, target-rich experience with friends exerts a stronger pull than usual.                            
70	                                Call of Duty: Vanguard is built like a rollercoaster so you have your highs, your lows, and moments that flatline. There’s no question its three modes are fun to play and offer fans enough content to keep them busy for some time, but this is Call of Duty, after all. Until Activision does something completely different with the series, don’t expect it to feel too different each year.                            
70	                                With a reasonable campaign, a great multiplayer mode and a good but scanty Zombies mode, Call of Duty: Vanguard is a nice new part. Whether that is enough is something you know best.                             
70	                                Call of Duty: Vanguard is a brave and accomplished charge from Activision into World War II. The intelligent way the campaign was assembled escaping from documented events but honoring the different archetypes of the piece combatants, made us sorry that we are not standing in front of a game with a heavier single player component. The core of CoD really is the multiplayer experience which seems faster and with various experiences but with the same good old feel, albeit with an MP40 in hand.                            
70	                                If you enjoy WWII shooters, you’ll still have a good time with Call of Duty: Vanguard. Sledgehammer Games have graced the WWII era once again with their innovative approach to multiplayer and packed it full of maps. The campaign, albeit short, gives you a unique view of WWII at the heart of one of the deadliest squads. And the Zombies mode? It exists, but the less said about it, the better.                             
70	                                A reliable entry full of variety and worthwhile content, that simultaneously leaves an aroma of staleness that is beginning to taint the whole Call Of Duty franchise.                            
70	                                It’s a great shooter game, CoD always is, but it's not the best in the series and the overly used WW2 backdrop is wearing thin. The pandemic would have played a part in this and kudos to the developers for still delivering a big game despite the lockdowns.                            
70	                                Call of Duty: Vanguard is another incredibly solid but also super safe instalment in the series. Its campaign may be over in a hurry but it's still a fairly memorable one, featuring good characters and outstanding visuals. Multiplayer is another robust package, hosting a ton of content and the promise of more to come. The less said about Zombies the better, but this is a Call of Duty game doing Call of Duty things. Whether that's of any interest or not, you likely already know.                            
70	                                Compared to Black Ops Cold War, Vanguard has a vastly improved multiplayer that feels like a solid foundation for Sledgehammer Games to build on throughout the seasons of post-launch content but with an underwhelming campaign and Zombies mode that seemingly needs a lot of work to win back the hardcore fans, it's not a bad Call of Duty title but it's certainly not one of the very best...Having spent several hours playing all three modes, I can safely say that it's definitely worth buying, specifically for the multiplayer which is surprisingly good for a change.                            
70	                                Like every year, Call of Duty tries to satisfy all gamers, no matter what they are looking for. Solo adventure, multi-competitive, collaborative zombie, free-to-play battle royale. A turnkey offer, XXL menu style, which this year lacks care at launch. We see it through the countryside which despite its exoticism offers nothing exceptional or memorable to experience. This is also seen in Zombie Mode, which at launch is only a rough sketch of what it should be and unfortunately lacks content. In the equation, the multi comes out with its head held high, offering several well-felt new features and still lively gameplay. More and more turned towards the “live service” and the updates of season, Call of Duty signs, with Vanguard, an episode of end of cycle, which asks only to evolve to improve and which turns out to be more enjoyable overall than the overall experience of Black Ops Cold War.                             
70	                                Call of Duty Vanguard is a good vintage. Far from being revolutionary, he at least has the will to offer a new perspective on World War II. We quickly become attached to this motley group. It is especially on the multiplayer side that there is much to say. The good idea is to take the gameplay of Modern Warfare to the letter, or even too literally, because this brings the flaws of the title of Infinity Ward. Activision doesn't want to jostle gamers, offering content that has been seen and reviewed for years while adding a few well-felt niceties like Champion of the Hill mode. Clearly, the multiplayer is a bit above Cold War, would be only in the sensations controller in hand and on the gunplay in a general way. Call of Duty Vanguard is not the opus of the revolution, but clearly does the job, offering agame that will hold up for the year to come.                             
70	                                The thing about Call of Duty games is that, with each yearly iteration, you pretty much know what you're getting--and that's largely the case here. It's both a blessing and a curse for Vanguard, however. Elements of Vanguard feel like good additions to the franchise, but its ideas also don't always mix well with the series' framework. That framework is still strong, and the solid gunplay, exciting multiplayer, and inventive moments of the campaign are worth seeking out. But forcing those two parts together exposes the seams in Call of Duty: Vanguard at times, weakening both parts of the game rather than pushing either one to the forefront.                            
65	                                It follows the formula of a Call of Duty game, but delivers each element just a bit worse than it's predecessors. Call of Duty: Vanguard is a game that will surely grow and improve over time, but what we have at launch is something that at least fails to cater to what I was hoping for in any aspect of the game. The single player campaign is ridiculous even if it does deliver some moments of high action; the multiplayer is a mess, at least for someone with my skillset; and zombies is simply unfinished. It'll get better, but what we've got right now just isn't all that good.                             
65	                                After the disappointing Cold War, Vanguard was the game that many fans have put their faith in. But due to rocky start, the countless bugs the completely unbalanced multiplayer and the incomplete zombies mode, this year’s Call of Duty is just another nail in the coffin of once great franchise. Shaken by various scandals on every front, it is clear that Activision does not care about anything else just cashing in the yearly checks. It is sad that the collaboration between Sledgehammer, Treyarch, Raven Software, Beenox and Highmoon cannot produce something more than Vanguard. The first Warzone season might improve things starting with 2nd of December, but I will not hold my breath.                            
60	                                Call of Duty: Vanguard is not the full package fans have and should expect from a franchise that consistently tops the sales charts. There are not enough positives to overcome the fact that the amount and quality of its content is sorely lacking. This is a blast from the past in the worst possible way.                            
60	                                Undead-battling co-op survival mode Zombies – an acquired taste I’ve regrettably never managed to stomach to any degree – rounds out a solid portion of CoD that can’t quite shake the notion it’s merely providing target practice until Vanguard’s Pacific-themed Warzone map enters the fray next month. Then again, perhaps that’s actually the point.                             
60	                                Call of Duty: Vanguard reminds us of the Call of Duty titles from over 15 years ago. And there is nothing wrong with a somewhat stripped-down reboot, but in this case, it feels like a lack of development time is the main reason for the cutbacks. The single player campaign looks terrific and plays great but has very few memorable moments. The zombie mode on the other hand lacks a lot of content at launch. Luckily, the main online mode offers plenty of content and the gameplay is as addicting as ever – even though everything feels very familiar.                             
60	                                Overall, it feels like a game that doesn't want to disturb and has no soul of its own.                            
60	                                Only by leaving WWII in the rear-view mirror does the game live up to the innovation promised by its subtitle.                            
60	                                Call of Duty: Vanguard offers an at times spectacular campaign and a fun multiplayer mode. Yet the authenticity of the Second World War is all but gone, with missing historical maps, teams and uniforms, leaving me wondering why the developers even chose this setting to begin with.                            
60	                                A lackluster campaign, a soulless Zombies mode, and a fun but diminished multiplayer offering round out a rather weak launch for the iconic FPS series.                            
60	                                Call of Duty: Vanguard contains a single-player campaign that is very promising on paper, but lacks the exciting finesse of previous Call of Duty games. On the other side, the multiplayer is fun and has a lot of good designed maps. The Zombies mode misses the mark completely with re-used assets being used from the rest of the game, simple to be filled with zombies, lacking any intriguing parts what makes zombies worthwhile. The whole game is technically a mess, but luckily the online part is fun.                            
60	                                At launch, Call of Duty Vanguard feels like a solid step-up from Black Ops Cold War, but falls short of the benchmark that was Modern Warfare 2019. Together, Vanguard's three pillars make for a game that we’re frankly surprised is as cohesive and enjoyable as it is.                            
55	                                Call of Duty: Vanguard is a very problematic game, that game at a very wrong time for Activision. Bad maps and uninspiring multiplayer and zombies modes are accompanied with a good story to create the game that needs to challenge both Halo Infinite and Battlefield 2042 for the throne. As a long time series fan - I wish them the best of luck - they're fighting an uphill battle here.                            
50	                                While it adds some interesting new features to the Call of Duty formula, Vanguard's mixed bag of changes makes it a forgettable entry.                            
90	                                Thanks to an impeccable production, NBA 2K22 feels more immersive and realistic than ever. Its gameplay is slower and more true to the game of basketball. Even though the RPG features of My Career are pretty bad, its content is still extremely rich. It all makes for the best NBA 2K in years.                            
90	                                There is a lot to love about NBA 2K22 which makes it one of the best basketball games out there. Besides just looking and feeling amazing, a lot of time and effort was put into ensuring this game wasn’t just a rehashing of last year’s version. From its smart tweaks on the court to its heightened level of realism in nearly every aspect of its gameplay, NBA 2K22 is the ultimate fan experience and delivers a season worth of thrills where it matters most.                            
88	                                Microtransactions are a trouble one more time, but, despite them, NBA 2K22 is one of the best sport videogames in history, because of its playable class on the court, its graphic muscles and its bench full of options. Visual Concepts wants to win the ring one more season.                            
85	                                NBA 2K22 requires a more tactical approach, making on-court play the best it has been, but VC still stalls enjoyment.                            
85	                                When we talk about gameplay and content, there's no rival to NBA 2K22, with a better defense on the court and so much improvements in every mode. The City is almost as big as every map in a sandbox... Unfortunately, the microtransactions are always there, in every move or step you take, and is a real pity in a great game like this.                            
85	                                NBA 2K22 is the franchise’s best entry in years, offering well-balanced changes on the court and a bold, yet welcome, revamp of MyCareer and The City hub. Microtransactions still frustrate at times, but they’re not as aggressive or tasteless as they’ve been in the past. For the first time in a while, it feels like the NBA 2K dev team is hungry, and they’ve cooked up a real championship contender this year.                            
85	                                NBA 2K22 does what it takes to make fans fall in love with the franchise again.                            
85	                                Immense in substance and respectable in form. 2K22 is worthy of the new generation of consoles, with gameplay and a career mode that erase the many faults of the past year.                            
82	                                NBA 2K22 shines on the court, while it struggles in the city. Visual Concepts did a great job getting back on the right steps its basket simulation, and the new shooting system feels good, the new defensive AI is tough and, overall, everything is in the right spot. The new MMORPG-like MyCareer is an ambitious and enormous attempt to maximize the retention of the players. Well, it tries hard, but it doesn't succeed.                            
81	                                2K22 is a step in the right direction, fixing and improving some of the concerns from the previous entry. There are still a few things that need work, but it is, overall, a fantastic basketball simulator.                            
80	                                2K Games and Visual Concepts can finally breathe : NBA 2K22 is the episode of reconciliation. With a Career mode which has been enriched and is gradually transformed into a Second Life game with sport (be careful with off-topic anyway), the MyTeam mode which includes the Seasons system and gameplay which tends even more towards simulation, NBA 2K22 is clearly a really good game.                            
80	                                NBA 2K22 is a great game in pretty much every facet, over than the overbearing VC issues that have been present for years now. Combining MyCareer with The City was a genius decision and the introduction of Seasons across multiple game modes will keep NBA 2K22 fresh moving forward throughout the next year while waiting on the next annual entry.                             
80	                                Even though some long running problems plaguing this franchise are still present in NBA 2K22 (microtransactions, poor defense, ads etc.) this year's edition is without a doubt the best we've seen in a long time.                            
80	                                Still the best Basketball simulation game on the market, NBA 2K22 does good but not enough to break into the 9th generation of gaming hardware as the PS5 version of the game is only superior to its PS4 counterpart in terms of visuals, and the RPG-like My Career mode and heavy reliance on microtransactions keep dragging it down.                            
80	                                2K is about as bad as it gets when it comes to quality of life for players in its online modes that are clearly designed to syphon extra money beyond the price of admission.  However, they do make one hell of a basketball game that will allow you to tolerate these scheme-based game modes if you can actually get on to play them.                            
80	                                Once again 2K proves they are the best when it comes to making a fun and entertaining basketball simulation game.                            
80	                                The shining spot for this year’s game is the defensive gameplay and the ability to truly challenge shots and defenders, especially in the paint. It’s extremely satisfying. While a bit of the game remains, NBA 2K22 still offers the closest television experience in a sports video game to date. However, that shot meter is still frustrating as the game remains geared toward its hardcore community who prefer grinding.                            
80	                                Aside from the unfortunate microtransactions and bloated hubs, the only fundamental low points are lackluster developments for MyLeague, MyGM, and The W. Each of these modes still plays well, but it's clear they aren't a prime focus. 2K22 doesn't offer much over last year's game for players who enjoy these modes aside from improved gameplay should they hit the court. Despite its flaws, NBA 2K22 still lands as a success for its on-court display, if nothing else. The game feels smoother, more intuitive, and really shines with the haptic feedback on PS5, which makes every move feel engaging. There may still be wrinkles to iron out, but the NBA 2K ship is heading full-steam ahead in the right direction with the release of NBA 2K22.                            
80	                                NBA 2K22 spreads itself a little too thin off the court, but it genuinely takes strides on it. The game’s rewritten defensive system makes for a much more enjoyable experience across all modes, where you feel rewarded for using the ball effectively and engineering open looks. MyCareer’s first foray into non-NBA activities could do with fleshing out, and there’s still an overreliance on advertising and microtransactions. But with one of the most complete Franchise modes on the market, and with exceptional presentation across the board, this is a series at the top of its game again.                            
80	                                NBA 2K22 does many things well, most of which has already been done well in the past. Exceptional, challenging gameplay keeps the strength of the game close to its chest, and NBA 2K22 offers an impressive spread of modes to complement that gameplay. Apart from a few misguided choices, the biggest crippling factor this year comes from how The City takes a good idea and stretches it way too thin. NBA 2K22 is great for hardcore fans of the franchise, but it doesn't leave the door open for many others.                            
80	                                Much improved over 2K21 and the best 2K in ages, NBA 2K22 is a strongest game still bogged down by legacy virtual currency and gameplay challenges.                            
78	                                Instead of walking into the arena and making a grand statement, NBA 2K22 just plays decent basketball. You'll see a few highlight clips, but none that make you want to keep watching in awe. Still, NBA 2K22 is an improvement over last year, even if it's disappointing that it's not making more significant moves. Hopefully, next year we see more shakeups to the lineup to make the game a little more exciting and feel like Visual Concepts is gunning for that championship title.                             
75	                                NBA 2K22 is a game that has as many virtues as faults. For instance, while shooting mechanics and visual presentation are a key enhancement to the experience, micro-transactions turn the online competition mode unbearable. It is these kinds of details that prevent this basketball title from being the best.                            
75	                                NBA 2K22 is seemingly a step in the right direction for the franchise. While I felt the same with last year’s NBA 2K21, I feel NBA 2K22 is more evolutionary than revolutionary. Its gameplay systems feel solid enough and fun enough to play for hours on end, however, the game’s heavy reliance on a player’s time to progress through any chunk of content is still prevalent. I would have liked to have seen more openness and choice to MyTeam’s new Draft mode, as it’s the best mode the game has added in years. Of course, I fully expect refinements to continue throughout 2K22s lifespan, so we’ll see where the game ends up in several months. But upon the first two weeks of release, there’s enough here to be excited for what’s to come.                            
75	                                NBA 2K22 is a sound step forward for the series. While it doesn’t always hit the mark thanks to the grindy MyCAREER mode and microtransaction-heavy MyTEAM, the gameplay and presentation is still second to none.                            
75	                                It’s time for Visual Concepts and 2K Games to go back to the drawing board with their microtransaction philosophy. At this point, it’s hard not to feel like they’re gouging the player. Especially given the exorbitant prices their premium edition versions cost. And it’s so damned frustrating to dislike as much of 2K22 as I did because behind every extra dollar asked of me was an excessively smooth compressed spin or step-back jumper to put a smile on my face. I like NBA 2K22. I wouldn’t say I like it enough to remortgage my home to play it.                            
75	                                NBA 2K22 is 2K Games and Visual Concepts’ best entry into the franchise in quite some time, with bountiful changes to certain gameplay mechanics that make this the most fluid basketball sim in years. Combining this with the new MyCareer story and how immersive The City has become, here’s hoping it’s a new era for the NBA 2K franchise, and it offers a much-needed bounceback for a series that many fans had started to give up on. We’re excited to see the evolution of NBA 2K throughout the year because what’s here is off to a more positive start than we’ve seen in a while.                            
74	                                NBA 2K22 is not more of the same. It has improved defense, playably is the best in many years, and has added what is effectively an MMO to its MyPlayer. However, the game still feels like early access in certain modes, with bugs that ruin the immersion in MyNBA, and monetization remains a problem for a player unwilling to invest or who doesn't have an edition with some Virtual Currency to use in their MyPlayer.                            
73	                                Although NBA 2K22 is the best and only new generation basketball game on the market, it is far from being a perfect game and continues to annoy with its microtransaction-oriented structure.                            
70	                                At the end of the day, NBA 2K22 feels like it comes with two separate modes: offline for those who just want to have fun and aren’t necessarily NBA superstars and multiplayer for people willing to spend real money and get their high-rated players overnight.                            
70	                                Low on innovation, big on fun… and slimy microtransactions. Despite the shameless 7money grab of certain modes, there’s lots for basketball fans to love. [Issue#7, p.91]                            
70	                                NBA 2K22 is the best-looking sports game of this generation, but flashy looks and incredibly deep game modes can't mask the on-court issues that plague this year's offering.                            
70	                                NBA 2K22's basketball feels more refined than last season. The revamped stamina meter leads to a more tactical team game and shooting is consistent and reliable. It looks as sharp and well-presented as ever and those wanting some quality time on the court will be well served. Unfortunately, the familiar encroachment of microtransactions dominate the MyCareer and MyTeam modes. The old problems with judging your performance also still persist.                            
70	                                NBA 2K22 continues to set the standard for gameplay, with changes this year that ensure a much more realistic and satisfying pace of play. But it's the same old story: it's one of the most aggressive games in the industry when it comes to micropayments, and its star modes can't be enjoyed unless you're willing to pay.                            
70	                                NBA 2K22 remains a very good basketball game but it rely too much on its assets and doesn't evolve anymore. It's difficult to see the differences between the 2021 and 2022 versions in terms of technology, graphics and content available to players. However, we notice the efforts made on the gameplay, which is much closer to the reality of the courts and less frustrating, as well as the care given to the My NBA mode. As far as the career mode is concerned, we're clearly left wanting more, it's just a lot of filler, to the detriment of the narrative quality of the career. To conclude, NBA 2K22 remains solid on its feet, still offering the best for a fan of the orange ball, but it's cruelly lacking in creativity and struggling to renew itself.                            
70	                                NBA 2K22 has the best offensive flow in years, matched by improvements to defense. Still, technical problems persist and microtransactions are hard to ignore in some modes.                            
70	                                NBA 2K22 offers the best on-court experience in the history of the series. That’s no small thing for a series long known for rock-solid gameplay. The problem is that so much around that experience feels incomplete or messy. NBA 2K22 provides such a wide range of experiences that many players will get what they need from it. The overall package, however, is a lot more uneven.                            
68	                                NBA 2K22 is generally a beautiful representation of next-generation console hoops, but it's a little disturbing that many of the newest things I noticed didn't have a whole lot to do with basketball. The on-court product is good, but it's not perfect. Basketball is still my favorite sport to watch, and I love the game, so I'll keep playing, but I can probably put the music and fashion career on hold — and I don't need to spend any more money.                            
60	                                NBA 2K22 is an almost impossible game to rate, because it’s a damn good basketball game at its core. The biggest problem is how it tries to be anything but a basketball game, and while that doesn’t damage the overall quality on the court, it makes it hard to root for it. It’s the ‘03 Lakers, and I hate the ‘03 Lakers.                             
40	                                NBA 2K22 is less a video game and more an advertisement for the sport. The controls are obtuse and unresponsive, slowdown is constant, the story is bland, and it’s simply not fun to play.                            
83	                                Although not a perfect remaster, seeing Sonic Colors get ported to contemporary hardware was a welcome surprise. The Sonic series continues to struggle with finding a way to incorporate gameplay hooks that don’t amount to shallow, pointless gimmicks, but in Colors SEGA discovered the perfect mix. With Ultimate, that balance has been restored for a new generation of players to experience. Hopefully, SEGA takes cues from Ultimate as it works on that mysterious upcoming 3D Sonic sequel. For those who played the original Colors, there’s plenty of reason for a double-dip with Ultimate, and for those who have yet to give it a try, this is the best 3D Sonic game there is. Give it a play.                            
80	                                Sonic Colors: Ultimate will be enjoyed by both fans who have already played the original game and new players. The former will be surprised by how good the title looks on Nintendo Switch, while the latter have the best opportunity to play one of the best Sonic games.                            
80	                                Sonic Colors Ultimate is well-executed revisit of a high point in Sonic’s long career. Most of the quality here stems from the content of the original, rather than the new additions and tweaks for this re-release. Things like the Jade Ghost and extra customization options are welcome, but not game changing, and the musical and graphical improvements are minimal. At the end of the day, though, this is still a well-performing, portable version of a classic and that’s arguably all that it needs to be. We’d give this one a recommendation, then, to anyone who has yet to experience Sonic Colors, as this is certainly the best and easiest way to try it out. If you’re a fan of the original, we’d still say it’s worth a punt — you'll still love the game on Switch. Just be aware that this isn’t a massive overhaul of what came before.                            
75	                                Sonic Colors: Ultimate revives a must-play Wii classic, with fantastic level design and great replay value. However, there are a few performance issues exclusive to the Switch version that prevent it from being the definitive way to play.                            
70	                                Sonic Colours Ultimate might offer a few extra bells and whistles over the Wii original but with it a bunch of bugs and rough edges too. It’s a real shame, as SEGA had a chance to take what remains one of the hedgehog’s best 3D adventures to date and make it even better. In the end, what we wound up with is a messy update that gets the job done but that’s about it.                            
70	                                While there are issues, both in the game itself and the porting, Sonic Colors Ultimate is a fun enough time.                            
70	                                This classic Sonic game offers some really fast-paced courses to run through, but the port can be very glitchy. It also looks and plays like a dated game. Unless you're a major Sonic fan, you might want to stay clear.                            
70	                                Sonic Colors Ultimate brings a very good game featuring an amazing soundtrack to modern systems with visual enhancements, but it is let down by some glitches and an overall lack of polish in its current state on Nintendo Switch.                            
60	                                I’d say there’s a great Sonic game here, and newcomers will find plenty to love. But if you own it already, maybe wait for a sale.                            
60	                                Sonic Colors Ultimate tries to offer a remastering of the original Wii, but fails in multiple areas. Although the base experience is still fun, this job leaves a lot to be desired.                            
60	                                At the end of the day, Sonic Colours Ultimate does offer a decent Sonic adventure. Everything you'd expect from a modern Sonic game is here: speeding through different acts, alternate pathways, hidden collectibles, great design, and, yes, unbalanced gameplay and a couple of bugs. If you're a hedgehog diehard, Sonic Colours Ultimate is most definitely worth a look, but if you aren't, then take this one with a blue grain of salt.                            
60	                                Finally, although Sonic Colors Ultimate is a very dynamic game and very pleasant to play, it still suffers too much from the flaws of the original game as well as from the various problems specific to Sonic 3D games. In spite of a handling that should certainly be reviewed, the game offers interesting gameplay elements as well as a particularly attractive artistic direction. But this new edition does not offer any real interesting novelties. Moreover, the game suffers from major technical problems on Switch.                            
50	                                I had re-played a bit of Sonic Colors on Wii recently to reaffirm how much I enjoyed it, and this remaster simply does not feel like an upgrade. At its best it feels just like the Wii game, and at its worst it’s an obvious step down. There is some minor added content like cosmetics that are unlocked through new collectibles, but they simply can’t outweigh all the problems introduced in this version. The original version of this game is a personal favorite to this day, but Sonic Colors Ultimate on Switch is just a disgrace that only succeeds at worsening Sonic’s already poor reputation.                            
90	                                Never would I have believed that in the year 2021 I’d be sat playing Diablo 2 on a console. And thanks to Diablo 2: Resurrected, with its wonderfully mapped controls and stunning visuals, it doesn’t have to be an eyesore or an ordeal. Some will instantly be put off by the lack of local co-op, but for those happy to play on their own or with others online, Diablo 2: Resurrected remains one of the best action RPGs of all time. It may be a bit clunkier than I remember it to be, but not offputtingly so, and once you’ve taken your first steps and started developing your character of choice, it’s hard to not be totally consumed by the game’s dark world and all that it offers. Diablo 2 is back, and until Diablo 4 emerges from the bowels of hell, it’ll do just nicely. Though I’ll probably be playing it beyond that, too.                            
90	                                Diablo 2 Resurrected is ridiculously gorgeous and enthralls us into its dark world, despite some annoying quirks from the past -  like the outdated item management - still being with us.                            
85	                                Diablo II Resurrected offers fans of the original game exactly what they want – the same game they left behind in 2002 with gloriously updated visuals. Everything works well on the controller (despite some inventory issues). New players might take a while to acclimate to the somewhat dated gameplay mechanics, but settling in, they will find a ton of enjoyable adventuring to be had with friends.                            
85	                                Diablo 2 remains a seminal ARPG and a defining gaming experience. For many Diablo 2: Resurrected is just another excuse to play a favorite. Other players may see it as an ancient relic, barely approachable with its stagnant, unevolved gameplay. For me, it was a harrowing hill to climb, a portal through time, but one I ultimately could not help but regret that I had not gotten to it sooner.                            
85	                                Diablo II: Resurrected is Diablo II in everything that matters. Its strict adherence to the tone, themes, and even gameplay of the original makes this an incredible time capsule, revisiting a classic restored, yet not iterated on. It’s the best of both worlds; a game that looks and plays wonderfully in 2021, but embodies the dark experience that was first brought to the world more than 20 years ago. They just don’t make games like this anymore.                            
85	                                Diablo 2 Resurrected is a brilliant way to rediscover an indisputable classic, whether you're a veteran or taking your first look back at Diablo's roots.                            
85	                                With its pros and its cons deliberately left mostly as sharp as they were, confirming itself as one of a kind not only for the nostalgia effect on which the Vicarious Visions have focused, Diablo 2: Resurrected has thrown the Blizzard masterpiece twenty-one years forward with a crazy care. It was not and is not a game for everyone, but what a pleasure to deal with the Devil again.                            
85	                                Rarely has a game been so aptly named. Diablo II Resurrected is indeed a true resurrection of a PC classic from the 2000s, in a technically updated version, but which scrupulously respects the original gameplay. A project that could have been a big deal in many ways, but Vicarious Vision has enough faith in the original material and hardly changes the game design and interface.                            
85	                                Diablo II: Resurrected did what it was supposed to as a re-release, and it managed to simultaneously preserve the original game.                            
82	                                A true classic of game history with a lovely new livery, however, outdated game design is cause for some frustration.                            
80	                                While the remaster brings little new to the table other than a fresh coat of paint, cross play and remade cutscenes. Diablo II and its expansion feel as exciting, threatening and as ruthless as ever. The lions share of the quality-of-life improvements are found in the console version, with an excellent use of the controller, added hotkeys and general accessibility. Yet, the remaster does nothing to dumb down or meddle with the overall experience. Instead, for returning players, this is Diablo II as you remember it to be. For new players, while missing a lot of features that most ARPGS have today, there is a lot to love about this aging gem and it is still worth experiencing even decades later.                            
80	                                Diablo II is one of the best ARPG's in gaming history, and Vicarious Visions haven't made many changes for Diablo II: Resurrected. Visually, there's a stark difference and it looks great while keeping the atmosphere. A few quality of life changes help keep this fresh and make it playable on consoles, but it just doesn't go far enough at points. This ageing master may have had a facelift, and it's one you can have a fantastic time with, but you can hear the creaking of its bones.                            
80	                                Diablo II: Resurrected brings the legend back in some style, with all the old joys and all the old pains as well. This 20-year-old holy relic is, in some respects, far surpassed by its successors and its systems sometimes grind to a halt, but the magic is still here, as strong as ever.                            
80	                                Diablo 2: Resurrected is a great remake of a real classic. It looks and feels just how I remember it from playing in the early 2000s, but with cooler lighting and sharper graphics. It has a few control issues with when using a controller, but it's still a must-play for anyone who used to play it and misses it, and a strong recommendation to anyone else who likes action RPGs, dark and grim atmospheres, or who just wants to experience a treasure from the now distant past.                             
80	                                Some technical shortcomings and a few content we would have liked to see but that Blizzard fails to provide. Nonetheless Diablo II was, is, and always will be a classic gaming experience and this new version certainly is the right tribute to the game, should you revisit or discover it.                            
80	                                An exacting remake of Diablo 2 that will not only please those that played it the first time round on PC but works impressively well on consoles too.                            
80	                                We enjoyed going back to Sanctuary. From its endless fighting and looting, to its characters and epic story. But if you don´t treasure memories from the original Diablo II (it´s been more than 20 years since it was released) this RPG feels repetitive and some mechanics are outdated.                             
80	                                A stunning recreation of Diablo 2, this will be essential for gamers of a certain age, while the uninitiated will probably get more of a kick out of it as a game design time capsule than a series contender in the sea of live games vying for their attention. If nothing else, Diablo 2 Resurrected is the definitive version of a classic.                            
75	                                Diablo II: Resurrected is a video game history lesson that everyone should know, but apparently they didn't learn from their mistakes. Resurrected is far from perfect and Blizzard didn’t use this opportunity to polish combat mechanics.                            
75	                                Diablo II: Resurrected is a mixed bag of treats. On one hand it has the sweet allure of nostalgia, on the other hand it often feels outdated, with mechanics that evolved quite a lot in the last 21 years. The multiplayer is tremendous fun and will cause a lot of discord over splitting the loot and stealing the gold dropped by the dead players. If you feel nostalgic for Diablo II: Resurrected is the best way to scratch that itch. If you felt that it was overhyped back then, the new release will do nothing to change your mind. And if you are new to videogames, you better start with Diablo III, since you will not miss anything story wise, and the experience will be much more satisfying.                            
70	                                Certainly it's great to see an all time classic enshrined and restored for modern day use. Additionally it opens up the game to exclusively console players that never played the original Diablo 2 on PC. There's no denying its significance in gaming history, and looks wonderfully sharp in 4k, but the age of the source code is evident. Diablo faithfuls will get a great nostalgic kick on the clunky ever-grind that is Diablo 2: Resurrected, but it would be a difficult recommendation for any series newcomers.                            
70	                                So it's a very, very good remaster (remake? It's unclear when this much has been done over), then, of a rather old loot game that has had many subsequent iterations from other developers. Is it worth going back to Diablo 2, ultimately, when games that we'd argue are somewhat superior — Titan Quest, the sadly PC-only Grim Dawn... even (controversially, yes) its own sequel in Diablo 3: Ultimate Evil Edition, which packs in brilliant local co-op that Diablo 2 entirely (and understandably, given its framework) lacks. As good as Diablo 2 is, it's an unfortunate fact that on console we'd rather play its follow-up, which felt more tailored to the joypad experience. Diablo 2 is a PC game that has been (brilliantly!) transferred to PS5, but it's still a little held back by its origins.                            
100	                                With an unbelievable look, tight gameplay, and bravura moments which shouldn’t work yet do, Song of Iron breaks away from the pack and stands alone. It is a stunning achievement and an absolute must-play. Hear the song and join the fight.                            
75	                                Song of Iron doesn’t offer a unique story or fresh gameplay mechanics, but it is still memorable for its great art direction inspired by Norse mythology. I was very impressed by how consciously the developer makes use of light, shadows and perspective. During the 5-6 hours long adventure you will slay hundreds of enemies and while the combat system is well-executed, the game’s intensity can be a bit tiring. [11/2021, p.52]                            
75	                                Song of Iron is a linear adventure, with a combat system that is functional but not very technical and never deeply satisfying.                            
65	                                Song of Iron is a short journey that struggles to keep us entertained, but in the end, it has some qualities that signify the potential that its lone creature has for creating better experiences in the future.                            
65	                                Like a weathered axe, Song of Iron needs polish. Its combat needs refinement, its bugs are frustrating, and its ability and item system need to be fleshed out more. Where it shines is in its soundtrack and presentation that showcase the ideas one person had to create the game he envisioned. And with its credits hinting at a sequel, there is no place to go but up.                            
60	                                The incredible visuals of Songs or Iron are not enough to make us forget the simplicity of its combat, its flat design and all the technical issues we experienced.                            
58	                                Song of Iron starts off as a promising minimalistic Viking adventure, before running out of steam and dipping in quality the longer you play - which isn't long, thus also putting its asking price into question.                            
94	                                Far Cry 6 is a very expansive first person shooter with a compelling story, full of entertaining things to do and missions to accomplish. The enemies are a little too predictable but the gameplay is always fun, with tons of weapons to find and customize, and the incredible “pets” you can bring with you are just the cherry on top. Graphics and sound are high quality and very immersive.                            
90	                                Far Cry 6 is a rare game that manages to do both story and gameplay extremely well, it's a game polished to perfection and our favorite open world to come in a long time.                            
85	                                Far Cry 6 excels in a lot of ways, with stellar visuals, performances, exploration, and story. But the character advancement mechanics have been reworked in a way that takes agency away from the player, forcing them to use the skills they can scrounge up instead of building the character they want. There is a mountain of fun to be had here; this pivot away from skill points doesn't ruin the game, but it also doesn't feel like the right direction for the series.                            
85	                                Far Cry 6 is the next iteration of the Far Cry universe, and you can see some of the blending from other Ubisoft properties here. While the formula may be a little more visible than we’d like, and the AI could use a shot in the arm, what is here is a thrill ride adventure sure to give fans of the franchise exactly what they are looking for.                            
83	                                Far Cry 6 is a game that does just what it should: gives you a good handful of gameplay mechanics so you can find yourself as a player within the chaotic Yaran revolution. Despite its imperfections, I will remember the game as a place I want to return to; as an open world that respects you as a player and understands that it should be you who decides how to spend your time with it.                            
81	                                If you had a good time with the previous games in the series, you're likely to find the same level of enjoyment in Far Cry 6. However, many of the gameplay elements in this new game are awfully like the versions that were first established in Far Cry 3 and reused with minimal changes in every subsequent game. There's certainly more than enough content to validate the game as its own, full entry into the series. I wish for a future Far Cry entry that I can play without being able to pick out which things are exactly the same as the previous title.                            
80	                                It all adds up to make Far Cry 6 a game that is obviously flawed and obviously similar to other Far Cry games before it, but has such a strong spirit that it ends up being memorable regardless. Far Cry 6 is a compelling reminder that video games can be so silly and that sometimes that's exactly what they need to be in order to be effectively cathartic. Yet in spite of that silliness, the game actually isn’t shy about having something to say. Here is a game that is many, many things all at once, but it also seems to understand itself so well.                            
80	                                We experienced the dictatorship in modern era! It is one of the best stories in the series. If you are a solid Far Cry fan, you will enjoy the game a lot, but it is not important, if you say you will play it later, you will not lose much.                            
80	                                Ubisoft is halfway for wanting to please everyone with a Far Cry 6 that cried out for much more risky decisions. It complies with note in most of the playable decisions, but neither the argument nor its great villain is at the height of what we expected from a great revolutionary adventure. A game that you'll like without loving it and that ruins the wickets that could have made it the best Far Cry in history.                            
80	                                The next installment in the open-world action franchise. It takes you to the island nation of Yara to topple a dictatorial regime.                            
80	                                We end up with a very efficient production, reconnecting with the exotic atmosphere specific to the saga and supported by some commendable efforts in terms of storytelling. Solid Far Cry, no doubt.                             
80	                                Far Cry 6 manages to tell a dark and gritty story with an excellent written and performed antagonist. The game also gets rid of unnecessary rpg systems and leans more back to the shooter roots of the series. Overall a better experience than the two predecessors but with lack of something really new.                            
80	                                Brainless violence. Far Cry 6 is selling a power fantasy at an industrial scale. If blowing up billboards, clearing up map markers, and delivering political power from the barrel of a gun is your scene, you’ll have a great time. For those listening to Far Cry’s marketing push and hoping for a more nuanced campaign (or even just a brief respite from the endless silliness) this isn’t the game for you.                            
80	                                Far Cry 6 is an immensely fun game that series fans and open-world aficionados won’t want to miss.                            
78	                                Far Cry 6 is the typical more of the same that adds nothing new to the formula. The hypertrophic open world with a plethora of missions doesn't match with standards of high quality: the product fails to renew a series that doesn't know how to look forward.                            
77	                                Far Cry 6 is an entertaining open-world shooter with an exceptionalvariety of weapons, albeit it gets carried away by an excess of features.                            
75	                                Far Cry 6 is still just another Far Cry, regardless of all the fanfare. It's formula is as old as time, but does find stable footing in Yara. With more emphasis on a good crafting system and the series' familiar freedom in playstyles, there's plenty of fun to be had shooting.                            
75	                                Yara is super lush and wonderful to explore, but the story and main villain are predictable.                            
74	                                Far Cry 6 features a beautiful world filled with chaos, but it also fits the status quo for the series without putting its actors and tech to good use.                            
70	                                If you’re looking for a game to unwind, then there’s no better place to look. But if you’re looking for something unique, something that will stick with you for years to come, you’re better off looking somewhere else.                            
70	                                Ubisoft won't change its Far Cry formula, but it doesn't polish it either. There's no effort made to improve IA and the whole tone of the game is borderline schizophrenic with fun and horror battling for attention. Despite this, Far Cry 6 remains fun and obsessive for explorers and completionists, with a ton of things to do and see (and kill).                            
70	                                If you have no prior experience with the franchise, Far Cry 6 is a game that can definitely be fun to play. If you're one of the series' devotees, you'll spot stagnation and repetitiveness in its mechanics from a mile away, to the point where finishing it at 100% is a real feat. Therefore, if you know what it's all about and haven't had your fill yet, then Far Cry 6 is for you. If you think you'll cry out "enough" if you see one more fortress, then leave it alone.                            
70	                                Far Cry 6 is often a fun game that feels like it's throwing everything at you, and if you want a heap of content, Far Cry 6 absolutely has you covered. In isolation, a lot of its elements are interesting ideas. Taken together, though, it feels like a lot of disparate things that keep taking your attention back to menus and map icons. It's a lot of exhausting extra stuff, when really, what Far Cry 6 is good at is giving me opportunities to blow stuff up.                            
70	                                The series' foundations have been rejigged to offer an exciting and satisfying new gameplay loop. Not all of the revisions work in its favour, but unfortunately it's the complete lack of change with its approach to storytelling and structure that really holds Far Cry 6 back.                            
70	                                Far Cry 6 is not a bad game, far from it. We have to admit that the scenery of the island of Yara is exotic and the story around Antón Castillo is rather interesting. However, the recipe is starting to run out of steam. The few new features are not enough to make up for a huge but cruelly empty map. As for the scenario, it quickly becomes a bit stale, with quests following one another without really managing to keep us in suspense. Nevertheless, if you want to dive into the heart of the guerrilla war with a friend, and not Chorizo, note that the game becomes much more fun with two players.                            
70	                                It sounds like I’m ragging on Far Cry 6 a fair bit, but that’s mostly just because of how much it feels like squandered potential. We’re at the sixth installment of this series now, spin-offs notwithstanding. And yet dismantling Castillo’s grip on Yara doesn’t feel too far removed from going up against Hoyt Volker, Pagan Min, or Joseph Seed. If you’ve played a recent Far Cry game, you know exactly what you’re in for with 6. It’s a well-trodden formula of epic scale that has just enough life in it to keep it from being tired.                            
65	                                Far Cry 6 finds the series at its most complacent and stale, showing little desire to push things forward and missing the mark when it comes to its story and villain. And yet, despite the tired recipe, there’s still an adequately enjoyable first-person shooter underneath that manages to offer the freedom expected of it and make popping the heads of countless dumb opponents feel satisfying. How much you’ll enjoy it really depends on where you’re approaching it from. As a new player, its world will keep you busy and show you a good chunk of what the series has to offer. If you’ve played previous entries in the series, you’re more likely to be left wishing there was more. Yara’s had its own revolution; perhaps it’s time for Far Cry to follow suit.                            
65	                                Far Cry 6 is two steps forward and a step back. The characters are brilliant, as is the work put into bringing them to life. Sadly, the game continues to be bogged down by more pointless content. The epitome of ‘less is more’.                            
60	                                I really wanted Far Cry 6 to be more than the previous games. A shake up of the formula that accounted for the violence of its setting. You're leading a revolution, starting a vicious civil war between entrenched factions, this is something open world games can reflect so well as areas of its land change based on your actions. But, disappointingly, it not only does little with its premise but is a poor version of things Far Cry has done well in the past.                             
45	                                Through an oversimplification of systems compared to previous entries in the franchise, everything in Far Cry 6 feels too safe…There isn’t any challenge to the combat, the exploration is mindless and the story that unfolds is completely unsatisfying.                            
40	                                Upon reaching the end of this review, I’ve come away with a revelation. Yes, Far Cry 6 is the accumulated chemical detritus from years of similar lab experiments, layered and stratified, compounded with time and pressure. But it isn’t a catalyst. I am. I played Far Cry 6 to completion: I pressed buttons to shoot guns and progress the plot; I killed an inordinate number of animals to buy upgrades; I equipped new pairs of pants to make myself stealthier. And at the end of it all, I felt nothing. I was unchanged by the experience.                            
100	                                Overall, Call of Duty: Vanguard is a very welcome addition to the Call of Duty franchise. Sledgehammer has always helped drive the franchise forward into adventurous new territories and Vanguard is no exception. If you find yourself itching for a new FPS in your life, Vanguard is ready for you to pick up and is easy enough to drop into so that you’ll never feel out of place as a new player. If you’re wary about picking this game up because you’re someone who didn’t like the change from 2019 Modern Warfare’s engine to Treyarch’s in Cold War, then you’ll be happy to learn that this runs on Modern Warfare’s engine and the gunplay and visuals remain entirely intact.                            
90	                                All told, Call Of Duty: Vanguard has exceeded my expectations, especially after a less-than-promising pre-launch Alpha and press event. Then again, the Beta was drastically improved overall so I was already feeling more optimistic by launch. I’m also very excited for post-launch content like Shipment, League and Gunfight, as well as more MP and Zombies maps. Now that maps are always free—replaced by a Battle Pass and cosmetic Item Shop—these games stay fresh and populated much longer than before, and I foresee a great deal of Vanguard in my future, though I’m sure I’ll dip back into Cold War frequently as well.                            
90	                                War never changes, and Call Of Duty is in fact still Call Of Duty. Sledgehammer Games however has happened across an intriguing formula, connecting what has worked in previous games and integrating it into their own. The campaign is stunning, and while short lived has a ton of heart, Zombies is as fun and maybe more inviting than it’s ever been, and the multiplayer hard carries this entry to a round 11 victory. This culmination of all things Call Of Duty has resulted in something the entire series can look to, a blueprint on how to build a meaty and superb first person shooter experience.                            
82	                                Popcorn shooter with an enormous and sophisticated multiplayer, somestory deficiencies and quite a short co-op.                            
80	                                While Call of Duty: Vanguard does what it does well, it’s as I wrote at the start: the expected experience. There’s nothing overly surprising here, no major shakeups to the gameplay, nothing that rejuvenates the franchise like 2007’s Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare. But that doesn’t mean it’s bad. In fact, Call of Duty: Vanguard offers a solid experience for those looking for their annual fix from the franchise. The campaign packs a punch and even manages to hit some emotional highs without dragging out longer than it has to. For Zombies fans, this will likely be a disappointing entry in the series, at least at launch. As for the multiplayer, it hits the Call of Duty gold standard of tight, fast-paced combat that players have come to expect. For those that dig the series, this one nails the Call of Duty experience.                            
80	                                Call of Duty: Vanguard clears the bar thanks to its convincing multiplayer, rich in content and with some new features such as the Battle Rhythm and wider environmental destruction, which reinforce an already solid gameplay. There is no innovation or revolution for the franchise, and those who have played the most recent games in the series already know what awaits them, but perhaps the secret of its commercial success will be precisely this.                            
80	                                This is a good Call Of Duty game, but outside of a cracking narrative it all feels rather safe. It’s a worthy purchase if you’re into the franchise, or just want a shooter to play with your pals, and the visuals are absolutely top-notch, but it does really feel like a filler year until we get the rumoured Modern Warfare 2 in 2022.                            
80	                                Call of Duty: Vanguard brings the franchise back to the roots. Not only because of the world war 2 setting, also because of the slower gameplay in comparison with a lot of other games of the franchise. The short, action-packed campaign is fun to play and the story of the historic inspired main characters is captivating. The multiplayer has a good balance, a neat pacing and offers with sixteen 6vs6 maps a good change. The Zombies mode is unfortunately the big weakness of Vanguard. It’s fun to play, but still missing a lot of content like the story and the popular Easter eggs.                            
80	                                Opting for pulp fantasy over Spielbergian reverence for the era, Vanguard reinvigorates the World War II setting and charts a new path forward.                            
80	                                Call of Duty: Vanguard’s campaign misses the mark, but multiplayer and Zombies do the heavy lifting to get the title to a good place. If you’re most invested in the single-player experience, you can pass on this year’s entry, but if you’re into the other modes, Call of Duty remains an excellent choice for some shooting, looting, and zombie executing.                            
76	                                Despite an immense amount of content, Call of Duty: Vanguard feels a bit like a step back for the franchise: a couple of guns need to find a better balance with the upcoming updates and the campaign is fascinating but extremely short and unripe. The game is genuinely fun, of course, but it's not the best Call of Duty to date.                            
75	                                Call of Duty: Vanguard drops the ball on two fronts. The campaign is a short, disjointed, and shallow affair, and its Zombies mode is solid but too bare-bones and devoid of content to recommend at the moment. Regular multiplayer matches are where Vanguard shines the brightest, but a lot of that is due to leaning heavily into familiar territory. Vanguard struggles to make meaningful additions to the formula, and apart from new battle pacing options and a generous selection of maps, Vanguard sits comfortably on the achievements of its predecessors. That's not a bad thing, and I enjoyed the online components throughout this review, but it's also not a great look for a yearly release. If you haven't played a Call of Duty title in a few years and don't care for its single-player campaign, Vanguard is a fun and solid entry in the series.                            
75	                                Overall, Call of Duty: Vanguard is another solid entry to the CoD series. Sledgehammer has worked almost entirely by the rulebook, but has made enough improvements to deliver a template that can carry the series forward for another year. There’s a promising lineup of post launch content on the way too, leaving the future looking relatively bright for the future of Call of Duty.                            
75	                                Call of Duty Vanguard is between modern and traditional. We still find our favorite game modes and some new ones that will please players. The weapons are well thought out with a configuration that is not unpleasant after reflection. The balancing is not bad and the TTK is really satisfying. The Campaign mode and the Zombie mode are unfortunately the black spots. The Zombie mode seems unfinished and the Campaign mode could have had a few more hours to dig a little deeper into the story of Vanguard. But we're not immune to additional missions for the campaign and the secret will finally be able to enjoy its secret by the first season.                            
70	                                With every new year, we get a new Call of Duty, and while this year's entry is decent, it's not essential. There’s still some good fun to be had here, but it never goes beyond expectations. In particular, Zombies in its current state feels like a lackluster step back. If you're an avid Call of Duty fan, Vanguard may still be strong enough to hold your interest, but if you've grown skeptical over the years, it isn't likely to bring you back into the fray.                            
70	                                Despite its impressive characters, Call of Duty Vanguard has an extremely ordinary story. Multiplayer modes are fun, but they do not feel like a new game.                            
70	                                As a huge multiplayer fan Call of Duty: Vanguard ticks all of the right boxes for me. It's chaotic and fast paced and besides some bugs that will surely be patched out, there's little to complain about. Unfortunately, the accompanying Zombies and Campaign modes are lacklustre and it is simply not worth buying the game for them alone.                            
70	                                Multiplayer is the only reason to play Call of Duty: Vanguard, thanks to substantial online content and a satisfying competitive pace. Both the zombies mode and the campaign are tiresome, clichéd, and mediocre, best left out of the history books.                            
70	                                Call of Duty Vanguard falls in the predictable traps of an annual release, but pulls through with a fun campaign and multiplayer at the cost of duller Zombies.                            
65	                                Is Call of Duty: Vanguard a good game? It depends. If it is your first Call of Duty, it will be one of the best experiences in your life. However, if Vanguard is your nineteenth Call of Duty you will find a visually impressive, yet hollow, campaign, a multiplayer that soon becomes routine, and a disappointing zombie mode.                            
63	                                Weak story with forgettable characters is punctuated with cookie-cutter multiplayer modes. Vanguard is a sum of its mediocre parts.                            
60	                                With Vanguard, Call of Duty returns to the roots of the series: World War II. The solo campaign is entertaining but short, and the multiplayer is exactly as expected: full of action and adrenalin. However, the few novelties are not spectacular enough to lift it above mediocrity.                            
60	                                Call of Duty: Vanguard does have its moments, even if they are quite few and far between. The campaign goes back and forth between innovative and entertaining, to repetitive and bland, while the Multiplayer and Zombie modes don’t bring anything new to the table other than how impressive they look.                            
60	                                Judged on its own terms, Call of Duty: Vanguard offers a solid, albeit predictable campaign, an engaging multiplayer with deep progression systems and satisfying gunplay, and a Zombies mode that will only serve as a minor distraction in its current state.                            
60	                                Call of Duty: Vanguard is the video game equivalent of an old war film that you’ve seen many times before, but still enjoy watching with a feeling of nostalgic comfort that armed conflict perhaps should not provide. It won’t set the world alight, but gives you the opportunity to blow a lot of it up – which is, after all, what we want from this series.                            
60	                                CoD's multiplayer is as dependable as ever, but Vanguard's campaign and Zombies mode fail to capitalise on what could be interesting ideas.                            
55	                                Vanguard is more of the same when it comes to the campaign, with very few sparks of innovation. It’s inoffensive, yet bland. Zombies tries something new but goes all-in with a single map that just doesn’t work well at launch. Multiplayer moves the focus away from the brilliant gunplay, pushing chaos above all else and making fundamental errors that shouldn’t be present in the 18th iteration of Call of Duty multiplayer.                            
50	                                In play, it is smartly dressed but simple, like a child of wealthy parents who can afford to be a bit dim.                            
80	                                While the start of Into the Pit is unquestionably rocky, the follow-through is a blast, with fast action and serious pyrokinetics as monsters turn into blood splats decorating the walls.  While the overall theme could have been dark and gloomy, everything lights up and the darkness becomes the backdrop for the neon-magical lightshow to illuminate.  The variety of enemies and level types helps each run stay engaging, and while fifteen sets of levels plus the final area can feel like a bit much, there’s no need to try to blow through it all in a couple of days.  Into the Pit is about action, after all, with only just enough story to get things moving.  There’s a village in trouble and a ton of monsters to destroy by way of magical annihilation, and if it takes a bit to rescue everyone they’ll be fine waiting for a combat mage to do a run or two a day until the evil is finally dispelled.                            
70	                                I like Into the Pit a fair bit. The graphical style is nice, the combat is incredibly fluid, and the mechanics there are easy to understand, but also have a noticeable effect when spawning new dungeons. However, I also found it to be a little bit too easy for the most part. The game requires a lot of runs in order to rescue more villagers and max out your character, and it doesn’t do quite enough to keep you drawn in versus other similar games.                            
68	                                Into the Pit is a good roguelite, with some interesting elements added to the pot. A poor polishing and the repetitive nature of its gameplay prevent the game to shine nor impress has it could have.                            
67	                                It’s a fast paced shooter, that feels really tight as a first person shooter. It’s meant to be played in fast bursts, so maybe it’s the perfect exciting thing to get you pumped while commuting on the bus. Or the kind of game where you breeze through the dialogue, turn off the sound and play while listening to a 25 hour audiobook. Into the Pit is a well-constructed roguelike shooting game and if you’re the kind of person who hears those words and yells, “I’m sold!” then you will probably have a lot of fun. But it’s not going to make believers out of genre-skeptics.                            
65	                                It’s no doubt that Into the Pit draws heavy influence from the Doom franchise, with its old-school graphics, fast-paced shooting, and rock and roll heavy background music, but the core gameplay loop makes it hard to recommend as a rogue-like. It’s fully functional and fluid with snippets of fun thanks to its brief runs, but its lack of variation for dungeons, weapons, and bosses makes it difficult to stand out from others in the genre.                            
65	                                Although it shows promise early on, Into the Pit runs out of new tricks astoundingly quickly, leading to endless repetition and a total lack of challenge.                            
60	                                Into the Pit is a retro FPS/roguelike that's far less than the sum of its parts. It's got great action, but everything that surrounds it is questionable.                            
60	                                Into The Pit rolls out new content far too slowly. With player upgrades that are mostly changing numbers around and rooms that aren't hard to puzzle out, playing becomes an exercise in enduring repeated content before finally stumbling onto something that makes things feel fresh. Even then, what does unlock often isn't enough to truly fuel more runs. At the end of the day, Into The Pit is too repetitive to truly succeed as a roguelike and too skim on content to survive as an FPS without those trappings.                            
90	                                Diablo 2 Resurrected is a masterpiece in its own right; it evokes a freshness all the while hitting players with an overwhelming sense of nostalgia. The sheer joy that is had when delving into dungeons to destroy the Lord of Terror and by extension is brothers (the expansion Lord of Destruction is included in this release with all of the classes/items and fixes that it brought back in the day. But players can play vanilla Diablo 2 but its not recommended for beginners) is indescribable. I am getting a giddiness just thinking about returning to the game, and not too many current video games can evoke that kind of feeling; and that’s where Diablo 2: Resurrected shines brightest.                            
88	                                Diablo II: Resurrected makes us forget the 20 years passed since the release of the original game, delivering the same incredible experience but with graphics capable of leaving us speechless. A pure, challenging and satisfying action-RPG, capable of providing endless satisfaction and countless hours of play.                             
87	                                Diablo 2: Resurrected achieves the perfect mix between nostalgia and updating the game. Its main flaw is that it may be a game focused on fans and not so open to new players.                             
81	                                Diablo II Resurrected is the best version of the game yet, and a classic reborn for the new generations. Maybe something more could have been done for the quality of life and extra features, but this is still a seminal game for the action rpg genre.                            
80	                                Time spent with Diablo II: Resurrected is certainly an enjoyable one. It isn’t as polished as Diablo III, but then this is a remaster of a 21 year old game and I fear the devs were pretty much painted into a corner: if they changed the systems, the original fans would be up in arms, but keeping the original feel does mean it slightly alienates players who are used to the newer game.                            
80	                                Diablo II remains untouched from its original release outside of new graphics and quality of life changes, but that's mostly not a problem. It was ahead of its time back in 2000, and it's barely behind over twenty years later.                            
80	                                Diablo 2: Resurrected is a faithful, meticulous remaster that shows just how well the original has aged.                            
80	                                If you've never played the original, then this is a great entry point. It's hard to hide its age even under the layer of polish, but Diablo 2: Resurrected is still a damn fine game.                            
75	                                A Remaster to the letter, Diablo 2 Resurrected introduces a new graphic layer on top of the original Diablo game, which is still available at the touch of a button. The inclusion of the Legacy mode shows both the progression in graphics and the truthfulness to the original in gameplay. While there are some quality-of-life improvements, we would have preferred quite a few more. Resurrected is especially suited for the hardcore fans of the original, provided they can wait for online to be included.                            
60	                                Despite being over 20 years old, Diablo II is a true classic and offers gameplay that holds up very well even today. However, the graphics do not, which makes it fitting that this remaster lovingly repaints the exterior but leaves most of the interior intact. Some parts would have benefited from some modernization however, and the unstable yet more or less mandatory online service can lead to great frustration and in some cases even loss of progress. An unnecessary fault in an otherwise superb remaster.                             
90	                                If you wish to spend another lifetime on Skyrim, this is the best way to do it. The Anniversary Edition brings more than 500 new items, quests and mods in the never-ending Bethesda's RPG.                            
85	                                Quotation forthcoming.                            
80	                                For those who have never played it or want to dedicate another 500 hours, this is undoubtedly the most complete version to date.                             
80	                                Aimed at those who are yet to experience The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim for the first time, this Anniversary Edition offers exceptional value for money, and is easily the best way to jump into one of the best role-playing games ever made. It may not quite look current-gen, but the fast loading times and reduced storage footprint are both meaningful gains for PS5 players, while the included Creation Club content adds yet more meat to the game’s bones which are already heaped with flesh. For those that have already played Skyrim to exhaustion, however, there’s not much here to draw them back. Though being able to upgrade from the Special Edition for just £15.99/$19.99 makes it very enticing.                            
80	                                So Skyrim's still Skyrim, but what does Anniversary Edition actually bring to the table? Well, with Anniversary Edition, you get complete access to the Creation Club. In a nutshell, the Creation Club started life as a poorly judged official mod shop, essentially offering DLC packs for premium currency. It took years for the Creation Club to stock up on any worthwhile content, but if you add it all together now, you're getting significant bang for your buck. Anniversary Edition comes with 74 'Creations' — from new quests and locations to weapons, armour, and player homes. If all you've ever known is Skyrim on consoles, then this avalanche of new stuff will refresh the experience to a surprising extent.                            
76	                                For any console player who already owns the Special Edition, some of the improvements of the Anniversary Edition are already available as free patches. Those folks will find the Anniversary Edition a reasonably priced add-on. It provides a significant new quest, some new mechanics, a new mode, and lots of cosmetic additions, plus access to the Creation Club and mods. Just don’t expect a graphical facelift. For console gamers without any experience of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim at all, the Anniversary Edition is definitely the version to pick up. With the Elder Scrolls VI in production, the Anniversary Edition is most likely (and hopefully) the final version of a seriously aging but still viable classic RPG.                            
75	                                The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Anniversary Edition continues to be exactly what makes Skyrim popular: a massive world to explore with tons of different ways to develop your Dragonborne. Outside of that, mods make an appearance and add a bit to the formula in their own way. Otherwise, this Skyrim is exactly as you remember, except it loads a bit faster and plays a lot smoother.                            
70	                                While perhaps not as enticing as it could have been, the additions that this version of Skyrim offer keep it from feeling like a total cash grab.                            
70	                                Skyrim is back yet again, with a graphical makeover and new user generated content, but at full price even fans of brazen commercial cynicism will find their eyebrows quietly reaching for the sky.                            
60	                                Skyrim Anniversary Edition is a pricey update to a legendary yet aging classic game. For those who already know it by heart, the free update will offer enough reasons to come back.                             
80	                                Skatebird is the kind of game that the world can never have enough of -- complex but accessible gameplay, unique gimmicks, and a clear sense of style. While there are a few kinks that need to be ironed out or settings that can be modified, they're largely outweighed by the unabashedly silly and enjoyable experience of playing the game. Skatebird is the perfect low-stakes, high-reward game to dive into right now, and hopefully other players will soon agree.                             
78	                                Through the fun story and throwback gameplay of arcade skateboarding, SkateBIRD delivers a refreshing game. Despite some frustrating moments with the movement and controlling of skating, enjoyment can still be found.                            
70	                                SkateBIRD is a silly little indie game that does quite an impressive job of adapting familiar skateboarding gameplay to a bird-sized world. Completing its missions and finding its collectibles may be rewarding but you'd wish there was much more to it than that.                            
70	                                Is it on the level of a Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1+2? Or a Skate 3? Alas, no, but SkateBIRD successfully stands out from the crowd with a unique premise, lashings of charm and solid mechanics. It’s not perfect by any means, and can often be a pretty frustrating experience, but with a plethora of menu options with which to simplify and improve that experience, it’s a game that should appeal to anyone who likes their games on four wheels and a deck.                            
70	                                If you've ever desired to roleplay as a variety of avian creatures with a tendency to pull off sick tricks on four-wheeled boards, then SkateBIRD is basically your only option. This cute indie game successfully delivers a goofy skateboarding experience most of the time, but annoying and plain inconsistent movement as well as some boring level design prevent SkateBIRD from being great.                            
62	                                Do you like adventures with absurd stories? SkateBIRD is your game.                            
62	                                SkateBird is just a regular skateboard game, make no mistake, but with a little twist. Its peculiarity, however, doesn't seem to add something very valuable to its gameplay, unfortunately.                            
50	                                SkateBIRD is a great gimmick. It is super fun to create a bird and the level design is definitely fresh. However, with its increasingly frustrating physics, repetitive challenges and bland graphics, it’s ultimately a poor copy of other better skateboarding games.                              
50	                                SkateBIRD has the skeleton of a great skateboarding game, but with the collision issues and the movement being as spotty as it is, it just brings down the entire experience. There were times in my play sessions I was having a blast pulling off combos and tricks and would come crashing down when I would hit a grind that didn’t work, or I would tap on the edge of a wall and fall off. Then on resetting my character would have the camera facing the wrong way and would be moving forward right back into the wall I just hit. It’s a sad truth, because under that, there’s a great skateboarding game here. Players looking for a new skateboarding game may get some enjoyment out of this, but keep in mind you most certainly will find issues with the movement. If you’re willing to put up with some frustrations, there’s something here for you, but if you’re easily bothered, maybe wait for a sale.                            
50	                                In an odd way, then, Glass Bottom Games has captured the truth of the situation; contrary to its mission of cuteness, it has made a game that feels hollow-boned, caged by unflattering mechanics.                            
50	                                Skatebird is a cute and original arcade skating game supported by great music, but the skating itself is crude by modern standards, the objectives are generally uninspired, and the camera is a regular hassle. It has a lot of charm, but overall it’s not really worth raven about.                            
80	                                As it stands now, Battlefield 2042 is a formidable and enjoyable shooter that once again delivers on the series promise of peerless open world combat theatre in a way that no other series or franchise has managed to match. It's just a shame that while Battlefield 2042 looks to the future for its setting, so too must players for the short-term as EA and DICE scramble to fix what could potentially be the best Battlefield in years.                            
80	                                An odd, but admirably experimental AAA game, which offers plenty of epic scale action at launch but whose true worth will probably only be revealed in the months to come.                            
78	                                Battlefield 2042 is a solid shooter that sadly suffers from a lot of technical problems, including bugs, glitches and a lot of visual inconsistencies. It's a game that has a lot of potential and offers a fun & team-oriented experience, but at the same time it lacks some key futures that, for no apparent reason, just don't exist. It's a hard game to recommend at the moment, but hopefully it will get better with time.                            
70	                                Battlefield 2042 is a good game at its core. It’s fun, frantic, and as engrossing as Battlefield has ever been. While the launch has been filled with a myriad of technical issues that I failed to mention in this review, those are sure to be ironed out over the next few months. The main issues I have with 2042 are some of its inherent design decisions. The majority of maps are too large to be impactful, the Specialist system has taken away a core aspect of what makes Battlefield work as a franchise, and the tone of the game is often at odds with itself. But through it all, I’m still enjoying my time blowing sh*t up, screaming and laughing with friends, and making more of those Battlefield memories.                            
70	                                When your squad is working together, Battlefield 2042 feels amazing. If you go at it alone or if your team ditches you along the way, the game feels too big to make you feel like you’re making an impact. As impressive as it looks, this shooter needs some love to polish off its rough edges and it needs a dedicated community of players to help its Portal mode achieve its true potential.                            
60	                                I wouldn’t say that Battlefield 2042 is the worst iteration in this series because it does add some new gameplay and brings back elements like complete loadout customization from previous iterations. But as of right now, a lot of the gameplay is skewed, and the weapons, attachments, and vehicles don’t really feel like they work as they should. As a triple-A game, I expect better.                            
60	                                Battlefield 2042 brings its share of greatness to the franchise, like the excellent Hazard Zone mode, but the usual bugs, the half-baked Conquest mode and some gameplay rollback are weighing on the general quality of this new iteration.                            
60	                                Battlefield 2042 is disjointed and incomplete at launch, but it's impossible to deny it still has that magic spark that made past entries thrive. There aren't enough maps and one too many bugs and glitches get in the way of the fun. However, with the excellent Portal mode to bolster it, Battlefield 2042 does just enough to get us on board. While we wish so many things were better, nothing else does it quite like Battlefield.                            
60	                                With all of the potential of an awesome futuristic FPS game at their fingertips, DICE and EA drop the ball on Battlefield 2042 with mediocre multiplayer, server issues and no solo campaign. Great ideas and great graphics can only go so far without a great execution.                            
60	                                Battlefield 2042 feels like it could become a cool game, but it’s tantalizingly out of reach today. There’s enough promise with the satisfying-when-it-works gunplay, large-scale chaos (that’s starting to feel more controlled over time), and fantastic legacy Battlefield content in Portal that I’ll stick around for a bit. It didn’t have to be this way, though.                            
60	                                Portal and Hazard Zone save 2042 from being a real low point in the series, which has swapped iconic, high octane moments for needless scale, without filling in any of that space.                            
80	                                If you think that Super Smash Bros. Brawl's "1/100 chance of tripping" mechanic ruined the game, then SkateBIRD definitely isn't for you. But if you'd like to embrace a little chaos while getting wild in a virtual skatepark made of paperclips and duct tape, then we're birds of a feather, and this is a game you should flock to. [Issue #56 – November/December 2021, p. 20]                            
75	                                Beyond the controls, the customization, and the music, there’s a solid core of skating here. You can easily fall into a calming loop of practice and progress. While it’s not perfect, SkateBIRD’s cute premise and its reliable mechanics make for a pretty fun ride.                            
75	                                SkateBIRD offers a similar skating game to some classics, but with a twist that can make it fun for people who don’t particularly follow the sport and its athletes. Plus, it’s just cute to see a bird with a Mohawk on a skateboard.                            
60	                                SkateBIRD is a game you'll want to love, it's hard to be let down by it. Unfortunately, all of the issues keep this game grounded. Get it for the bird, not so much the skating. Developer Glass Bottom Games made a cute indie skating game, and it seems they're still supporting the game so it could address some of the issues. For now, SkateBIRD's appeal depends on how much you like to commit to a bird-based skating game.                            
60	                                SkateBIRD has fun gameplay, responsive controls and excellent art, with an emphasis on the soundtrack and character creation, but it has some technical issues and a campaign sometimes tedious and with tiring missions that end up overshadowing what the game's full potential has to offer.                            
60	                                SkateBIRD is ultimately, incredibly charming, but incredibly flawed. It’s fun, when it doesn’t punish you for its own shortcomings, and the blurry backdrops are straight bargain bin-PS1 fodder, but I still can’t help but get drawn back into the odd, goofy world of these skating, winged weirdos.                            
60	                                For what it is, SkateBIRD is a fun and interesting title unlike any other. While it may have some flaws, they don't run so deep that they break the game or make it entirely unenjoyable. For those looking for a casual skating experience with a fun soundtrack, this is an easy one to recommend.                            
60	                                SkateBIRD is a fun, if flawed, experience. Charming, with a light-hearted story and a good sense of humor, there’s plenty to enjoy, even with the overly floaty feeling that hampers the controls. While it’s likely not the best skater you’ll ever play, it’s probably one of the more unique ones. I don’t think I’d really recommend it to hardcore fans of skater games, but for people looking for a casual experience you can pick up anytime and not feel too invested in, it might be worth a look.                            
60	                                Skatebird's rough skating mechanics are offset by its charming internet-age humor.                            
50	                                Performing bold moves is always great but the camera needs improving toprevent some frustrating moments, whereas the mechanic to execute someof the most complex tricks is rather questionable. Regardless of that,SkateBIRD is a fun, simple game, and one that will absolutely make fanshappy.                            
50	                                Despite its chill and charm, SkateBird fails to capture the basic essence of a skateboarding game, leaving you wanting something more.                            
50	                                Skatebird would have benefited from a little more time in the nest. The game's technical problems make it hard to appreciate the positive aspects of its world. There's definitely room in the market for a more casual skateboarding game, but it needs to have the fundamentals worked out first, and Skatebird isn't there yet - though it has promise if future updates smooth out the experience considerably.                            
50	                                SkateBird was a game I anticipated since I first heard about it. A whimsical bird-focused take on skateboarding seemed delightful, but in execution, frustration dominated my playtime, whether it was struggling to find missions or battling with the loose controls. Charm is the saving grace that led to me having short-lived enjoyment. Overall, SkateBird is way more reminiscent of the janky but sometimes enjoyable games that came out in the wake of Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater’s success than the original product itself.                            
50	                                SkateBIRD is a creative addition to a genre lacking in variety, and its fun concept has clearly been realised with a lot of love. However, despite its potential, the best parts of the concept are underused, with neither the miniature skaters nor the addition of wings bringing much to excite. While the core gameplay is functional, the play feel is not fluid and the level design and laborious structure are always working against the fun. To top it off, the rudimentary graphics are needlessly hazy. More of a turkey than a pretty boy, then, unfortunately.                            
40	                                Humorous dialogue and bird customisation don’t do enough to stop SkateBIRD from falling far down the pecking order of skateboarding games available on Switch, with boring levels and controls that are janky and frustrating at best.                            
40	                                You can have a great concept, nice visuals, and plenty of novelty, but it’s all for naught if the game doesn’t feel good to play. Unfortunately, SkateBIRD has a lot of issues in that regard. The physics lack weight, which I can forgive to an extent because they are birds. The ridiculous camera is harder to get past. Anytime you’re near pretty much any object, the camera has a tendency to start going haywire, making it hard to point yourself in the direction you want to go and really easy to fall off of raised surfaces. Your birdie boarder also falls off its board at the drop of a hat, and between that and the camera you can end up in some very frustrating situations. All of the charm in the world isn’t enough to save this one.                            
40	                                Despite its amusing concept and charming vibes, Skatebird can’t get far when it actually gets on the board.                            
20	                                I’m glad that I played SkateBIRD, and it hurts that I’ve had to give it this score. I firmly believe that as games are an art form, game developers should be trying things, even if they don’t ultimately succeed. SkateBIRD is a brilliant idea and it takes a big, heaving swing at it. Sadly, though, it’s a strikeout. However, with that being said, if the developers get another innings, I would play a SkateBIRD 2 without a moment's hesitation, and I would fully expect that the developers would deliver having had this experience.                            
95	                                Even without the nostalgia creeping in, one can plainly see that this is a game for the ages. Cross-play would make this the perfect release for me, but even as is, I love this game.                            
90	                                The Lord of Terror has never looked so good, with Diablo II: Resurrected taking the original, and improving its look so as to present it to a whole new generation of gamers, or to those who are still in love with the 2000 classic by Blizzard North. There's not much here in the way of additions or changes, which is definitely a wasted opportunity to practically offer the best ARPG ever made, but it's still hard to say no to such a devilishly good remaster. Good job Blizzard. Finally.                            
90	                                Diablo II: Resurrected is a huge accomplishment for a remastered game. It preserves the original game in amber while still showing just why it was considered a legendary game in the first place. It is perfect for veterans to jump back in and play as if you have been playing it for the last 20 years. It is also still approachable to new players who can finally see what all the hype is about.                            
90	                                Diablo II: Resurrected presents the very best version of an all-timer, and benefits from all of the patches and updates it received from Blizzard in the early part of this century. Stuff that helped fine tune an already great game, turning it into something that stands the test of time.                            
90	                                Vicarious Visions and Blizzard Entertainment have done something amazing with Diablo II: Resurrected. It is much more than a tribute. It is a sign that the first game is unrepeatable and that it remains so fresh despite the years (at least for some, because it is evident that it aged particularly badly). Therefore, Diablo II: Resurrected is a careful recommendation. It is a game for veterans of the original, fans and curious.                            
90	                                The fires of hell burn hotter than ever, bringing the tale of the Dark Wanderer back in an eye (and ear) blisteringly good way.                            
90	                                Diablo 2: Resurrected is made for Diablo 2 veterans and is proud of it. Being one of those veterans, I can't predict how a modern audience will react to this idiosyncratic arpg, but I can say that in my eyes this is the perfect remaster (and not a remake). Hell has never felt like such a warm bath.                             
88	                                Diablo II: Resurrected shows why the original title remains the standard against which all other ARPGs are judged. While it doesn’t come with many hooks and ever-evolving content that has become a baseline for the genre as it transformed into a game-as-service model, not all games need to be played with forever in mind. Diablo II: Resurrected proves that Blizzard’s classic is still a blast, even today. Whether it’s your first foray into hell and beyond or your thousandth hour, Diablo II: Resurrected is worth the time.                            
86	                                Diablo 2: Resurrected is a game that goes far beyond the nostalgia of the fans. A solid title that reminds us of what Blizzard has meant to video games and makes us understand why we need it to come back someday. Whether or not you enjoyed it twenty years ago, it is truly a must-have.                            
86	                                Aside from the graphics, Diablo II hasn't really changed all that much since its debut in 2000, but Blizzard classic ARPG has aged gracefully and is still a deeply engaging and fun experience.                            
85	                                I’ve enjoyed playing Diablo 2 Resurrected and getting to experience the story in a visually updated way. The tweaks they made to get everything working on the console also helped a lot as it gave me far more flexibility in what abilities I had at my disposal. D2R is ideal for anyone who likes dungeon crawlers and doesn’t want everything to be explained or to be told where to go all of the time.                            
85	                                Diablo II: Resurrected is a faithful remaster of the original that defined the gold standard for the action role-playing genre. With 4K graphics, a higher frame-rate, fully remade cinematics, and a vast array of quality of life changes, this is an experience that serves as a love letter for nostalgic and veteran players and an enticing invitation for newcomers.                            
85	                                Diablo II: Resurrected is a product that appeals towards the longing of the community. It adds new functions that bring it up to speed with modern games, but at the same time, it still feels like an old-school title, which might alienate some people.                             
85	                                Diablo II: Resurrected delivers on the promise of a rebuilt original, without tampering with the soul of what made it amazing in the first place. With completely remastered graphics, all-new cutscenes, and console cross-progression, Diablo II: Resurrected takes us back to Hell, and it’s every bit as amazing as it was when we played it 20 years ago.                            
85	                                Blizzard has done a fantastic job giving Diablo II a very, very elaborate facelift, keeping the essence of one of the most influential games ever intact.                            
83	                                In those areas where Diablo II: Resurrected attempts to improve on the original, it absolutely succeeds. It looks infinitely better, it’s more accessible to a wider range of gamers, and it mostly feels like it deserves to live on current-gen systems. At the same time, some of the changes seem arbitrary when looked at through the lens of what could have, and should have, been updated. Part of Diablo II: Resurrected feels wonderfully nostalgic and timeless, but another part feels mired in outdated mechanics from decades past, and pretty graphics alone can’t fix that.                            
82	                                If you enjoyed the original Diablo or Diablo II when it first came out… this is a great way to play it on a modern system without having to jump into a DOS box or wrestle with other settings to get it to work. If you like the idea of a loot clicker then grab a copy because this is a great example of it.                            
82	                                A gorgeous remaster of an unmatched masterpiece, but in terms of gameplayadditions, it offers only the bare necessities.                            
80	                                Diablo 2 is back in a Resurrected version and could appeal to purists as well as young people eager for challenges: The plastic has been completely revised, everything has been modeled again, and is now very flattering for the retina. The atmosphere of the game is as crazy as ever even though the storytelling has gotten a little old. The same can be said with the gameplay, which has hardly changed an iota: it's still just as nervous, addicting, devilishly catchy, but at the cost of sometimes outdated ergonomics. Nevertheless, we do not shy away from our pleasure of replaying this legend in conditions much more in line with what is being done in 2021.                            
80	                                Even after more than 20 years, smashing monsters and looting to your hearts content is as addicting as ever. A fantastic visual overhaul and some much-needed improvements make this the best version of Diablo 2 so far. However, a lot of outdated mechanics remain untouched, from shared loot and uneven balancing to an overflowing inventory that constantly interrupts the action. Even basic stuff like stackable gems or some useful tutorial screens didn't make it into this remaster. Blizzard is clearly catering to fans of the original, even if that means the remaster may never reach its full potential.                            
80	                                Diablo 2: Resurrected Review – For the FaithfulByEd McGlonePublished on September 30, 2021Home » Reviews » Diablo 2: Resurrected Review – For the Faithful    Share    Tweet    Night Mode Diablo 2 Resurrected on PCDiablo 2: Resurrected is a remaster simultaneously complex, and also incredibly simple. Visually, it’s a night and day difference between its predecessor, even on the Switch. But from a gameplay perspective, it is incredibly faithful, almost to a fault. Very little has been changed from the original release which will likely be music to the ears of the most hardcore Diablo 2 fans, resistant to change. In that sense, it’s a very “simple” upgrade. However, that decision not to use this opportunity to spruce things up may end up being a thorn at the side of newcomers and fans without rose-tinted glasses.Let’s talk about what Diablo 2: Resurrected gets right first. Visually Diablo 2: Resurrected is a triumph. It takes a very old game that looks, let’s face it, like ass by today’s standards, and turns it into something charming and wonderful to behold. By charming and wonderful, I of course mean gory, gothic, and dark with a new level of detail that was not possible in the original game. Fans wouldn’t have it any other way in that regard.Gameplay-wise, very little has changed because very little needed to change. Diablo 2 is still an all-time great game and that is still the case in Resurrected.All of the game’s classes are incredibly distinct from each other and each has a multitude of different play styles you can elect to spec into. There are Trap Assassins, Elementalist Assassins, Bow Amazons, Javasons, Werewolf Druids, Werebear Druids, Hammerdins, Whirlwind Barbs, Summoner Necros, and Bone Necros, Ice, Fire, and Thunder Sorceresses, I could go on and on.Layered on top of that are gear and set items that can further augment your gameplay and of course the fabled Runewords that players can chase to really perfect their builds. Leveraging all of that and creating your perfect character is definitely a grind. It’s a grind that may not make sense to an outsider, because at the end of the day you’re just running through the same content you did before, just faster, but those of us that love the genre do get it and love it for what it is.What’s great too is that players now have an easier way of getting to experience the lore, environment, and story of Diablo 2. Diablo 3 had a really compelling story that is heavily connected to the events of Diablo 2. While you can still enjoy Diablo 3 without having ever played its predecessor, it’s far more enjoyable if you do know fully what’s going on. And with Diablo 4 coming at some point in the future, it’s absolutely worth a single playthrough for the story and to experience this legendary game at least once, even if you’re not planning on staying a while or killing Baal 10,000 times.All of that said, while yes, Diablo 2 is still an excellent game, it never was a perfect game, and there are some issues that were forgivable back when it was originally released that stick out like sore thumbs now in Diablo 2: Resurrected.I have extremely fond memories of Diablo 2 going back to my days in middle school and high school. My friends and I would spend hours perfecting our magic find gear and mastering our speed runs through Mephisto and Baal to grind for better loot.The funny thing about memories, though, is that sometimes your brain selectively chooses to remember good ones, and deletes all of the bad ones.For example, I barely remembered that Stamina was even a thing, and yeah it’s very much a drag early on. While it improves over time as you pump up your Vitality, I can totally see fans that are not married to the idea of loving Diablo 2, getting frustrated very easily over it, and giving up on it before it starts to resolve itself.If the frequent battles with your Stamina in the early game don’t scare players away, the inventory management might. This is another Diablo 2 memory I subconsciously left behind apparently.I do not remember having to constantly go into my inventory to either drop stuff, or go back and forth to town to stash and sell items as often as I apparently need to while playing Diablo 2: Resurrected.Did I just never pick things up in the original game? Did I just not know anything better back then? I don’t know the answer to those questions, but the reality is that in 2021 it’s kind of brutal and not in a good way. Your choices are basically to be extremely selective on what you decide to stop and pick up and then possibly miss out on upgrades, or just spend most of your gameplay time in your inventory.While I’m fortunate that the version of Diablo 2 that contained respeccing made it into Diablo 2: Resurrected, I would have really preferred to just have unlimited respeccing as you do in Diablo 3. As it stands, it’s a pain in the ass to experiment and you’ll need to really commit to your play style and resort to starting a new character if you want to have easy access to something different.Finally, let me just also add, that the lack of a local couch co-op option for console players is a total bummer. I have to imagine, considering Diablo 3 had the option, that it probably wasn’t a philosophical choice, but rather it probably just wasn’t possible. Still, that doesn’t make it any less of a disappointment.I know that hardcore Diablo 2 fans don’t want to even entertain the idea of Diablo 3 seeping into their beloved game; I totally get that sentiment and don’t want a watered-down version of Diablo 2 either. However, a few modern touches, addressing the three biggest pain points I mentioned above would have gone a long way to properly resurrecting Diablo 2 and making it a premier ARPG in 2021. It doesn’t reach that potential, sadly, but it’s still an all-time great game that mostly holds up as long as you can look past its dated features.                            
80	                                Beneath the beautiful new look and smart innovations, this is the same Diablo 2 that came out in 2000.                            
80	                                Diablo 2 Resurrected is what a remaster should be. Vicarious Visions has done an incredible job with what is the cornerstone of the Action RPG genre. A visual gem that still holds against any modern title. The gameplay hasn’t changed an inch, which is what the whole community wanted. More brutal than ever. An isometric Dark Souls to terrorize the new generations of gamers.                             
80	                                Successfully brings an icon into the modern era, and the underlying gameplay still shines. But while Resurrected does a better job than Warcraft III: Reforged, it leaves similar questions unanswered over its feature set and long-term community support.                            
80	                                Overall, however, we can only be satisfied with the outcome of the nostalgia operation implemented by Blizzard, which will once again trap fans in an endless cycle of fights to the death and unbridled looting.                             
80	                                The lore of Diablo is as interesting as it ever was even if the storytelling isn’t nearly as fleshed out as one would see in modern games. Giving a facelift to a twenty-year-old game without updating the gameplay is a gamble, but thankfully that is exactly what we got with Diablo II: Resurrected which is how the original fans would want it.                            
80	                                At the end of the day, Diablo 2: Resurrected certainly feels like a game that is designed with veteran and nostalgic players in mind and it truly nails the experience in that sense. Whether it’s going to be able to build a new audience with first-time players is a much tougher question, but the old school experience may have more to offer modern gamers than it appears at first glance. Diablo 2: Resurrected fills a very unique spot in the franchise’s offerings by allowing players to continue returning to D3 (and someday Diablo 4 for a modern experience), but also now having a visually modern option when they want a bit more baseline difficulty and a classic experience.                            
80	                                Quotation forthcoming.                            
75	                                If you don't run afoul of the game's technical and server-related issues, you'll find Diablo II: Resurrected to be a good version of the classic action RPG. For those who have played with the 2000 PC classic countless times, this is a like-for-like copy of that title, only with a few more accessibility options and a new lick of paint so it blends in with modern releases. For those who are new to the game or are more familiar with Diablo III, keyboard and mouse players will feel limited, while the lack of modern quality-of-life amenities can dampen the excitement for the title. Either way, once everything clears up, Diablo II can become a great addition to any ARPG library, and if you're one who pays attention to the review score, you can bump up the number when the fixes roll in.                            
75	                                Diablo 2 Resurrected is a beautiful journey down memory lane. It's a game that brings out memories and joy and, sometimes, rage (it can be brutally unforgiving). This new-old Diablo 2 took us home for a while. A sweet illusion, but its longevity depends on the work the developers still have to do.                            
75	                                Diablo 2 Resurrected has a stunning graphical overhaul as well as satisfactory controller support, but it's really not a remaster for the masses: it's primarily aimed at fans of the original title. Nostalgia won't necessarily be enough to make you forget the lack of modernization of many interface or gameplay elements. So it struggles to compete with the many newer games in the same genre on many levels. Let's hope for more changes in the future. Even if it doesn't impose itself as a modern title, we still recommend it to players looking to discover this great classic in good conditions, knowing that it offers an almost unlimited life span to those who are hooked on its old formula.                            
70	                                Diablo 2 Resurrected should have been a remake. The approach might be more streamlined than most modern RPGs, and combat is just as enjoyable as it ever was. However, it's also difficult to recommend for those unwilling to push back against the game at almost every turn. If you're familiar with the original and know its quirks already, the visual refresh is enough to warrant yet another playthrough.                            
70	                                Diablo 2: Resurrected both benefits and suffers from its faithfulness to the original title, but overall provides an adventure full of satisfying gameplay and fun exploration.                            
70	                                Diablo 2: Resurrected updates the graphics of a great, classic action RPG for a new generation. It masterfully preserves the mood of a singular game, and at the same time it preserves the gameplay as it has been for over a decade – mostly for better, occasionally for worse. Unfortunately, parts of that gameplay that were standard 20 years ago just look bad now, or feel like a waste of our time. Those looking for the old king can find it right here, but they might want to politely bow rather than kneel.                            
70	                                As a big Diablo 2 fan, Resurrected has let me down in many ways. What little changes have been made to the original formula are welcome, but feel like leftover bread crumbs from a larger pie that could have been. Diablo 2 was in a bit of a weird place in that it was not hard at all to access and play the original game, even on modern PC hardware. This new release does make the game available to console audiences, which is an awesome change, but the lack of crossplay really hurts here. Resurrected could end up becoming a much better value down the road as the development team begins introducing updates and upgrades, but as of right now, you should avoid this package unless you are happy with straight-up Diablo 2. That being said, there are many reasons to be thrilled to revisit the game, particularly for the timeless soundtrack and to get a glance at the spiffy new paint job. Just make sure to set your expectations accordingly.                             
70	                                Eventually, and with a lot of googling, I found my groove and started to enjoy what Resurrected has to offer. Just make sure you go in prepared for the clunkiness.                            
70	                                Diablo 2 Resurrected achieves what it set out to do: remaster Diablo 2. Its enhanced visuals and spectacular cinematics repackage the game in a whole new way, making it feel as though it really is your first playthrough all over again.Breaking this immersion, though, are a slew of irritating bugs that are likely to be fixed soon. As patches drop over time we hope this sorts itself out, but at the moment they can be so game-breaking that they make you want to do diabolical things to your computer. Despite all of this, I’m excited to jump back into the game. In fact, I’m itching to do it. Why? Because evil has returned, and it’s the Diablo 2 I know and love.                            
65	                                The beloved classic returns with a lot of promise… but it doesn’t quite meet our lofty expectations. It looks, sounds and plays great, but there are downsides: you’ll find loads of bugs and glitches, some important features are missing and it turns out you can actually be too faithful to the original.                            
60	                                It's why, unlike Diablo III, I don't foresee myself spending a lot more time with Diablo II: Resurrected. That's not to say the adventure was without merit, and it's certainly great to have a way to play one of Blizzard's classics with a coat of paint that does its visual aesthetic justice so many years later. But outside of players already well-versed with the game's aged design choices and imbalance, there's not a lot here outside of a history lesson for new players to enjoy. A lot of the time spent playing Diablo II: Resurrected, I just longed to return to Diablo III.                            
60	                                Diablo 2: Resurrected is, if anything, a faithful remaster of the original game. The visual overhaul and fantastic cinematics maintain the dark tone of Sanctuary’s horrifying demons and tales. Unfortunately, that alone doesn’t hold up after 20 years of innovation. Annoying gameplay mechanics, constant selling and buying, restrictive controls, regressive character art, and finicky UI poorly date this adventure. More quality of life changes should be here to truly bring the classic back to life. Diablo fans may love this remaster; others will likely not.                            
90	                                FIFA 22 is undoubtedly a step forward for the franchise, and the new Hypermotion engine on new-gen consoles is totally worth it, though it’s pretty clear it’s not everybody’s cup of tea. EA clearly has a lot of things to polish in FIFA 22, and the first update that is already live on PC is the living proof the company is very committed to doing this in the short term.                            
90	                                FIFA 22 introduces us to the biggest gameplay change in years to bring more realism to a game mode that, although it does not need it, does bring it closer to the sport from which it is nourished.                            
90	                                The team left no stone unturned for FIFA 22 and went all out in making a supremely-improved football game. The gameplay is the best the series has ever offered and makes the game fun no matter what mode you choose. The managerial career is the stand-out mode here with the ability to create a club and manage every aspect of the team. The player career offers a ton of meaningful upgrades that actually make you feel like you’re accomplishing something. VOLTA has been simplified but made more fun. But it all starts with the gameplay thanks to HyperMotion and the machine learning technology that brings excellent realism to FIFA 22. Even if you’re not a soccer/football fan, the controls of this game make it worth a try to at least play with friends. FIFA 22 may just be the best sports game of this generation so far.                            
90	                                FIFA 22 features tons of big changes in every element of gameplay, making this year's iteration the best version seen to date.                            
90	                                FIFA 22 is the best FIFA game in years. HyperMotion pushes the action along, with a renewed focus on Career Mode more than welcome. It’s a more refined, well-developed package this time around, and I’m excited to see where the series is headed in the future.                            
89	                                FIFA 22 on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S is definitely the next big step for the series – thanks to its better graphics, overhauled gameplay and a more realistic approach to football. However, Electronic Arts still has to sort out some balancing-issues that come along with the next-gen-technology.                            
86	                                FIFA 22 is the most interesting and deep entry in the series from years to date, thanks to its new physics, AI and level of details. FIFA 22 gives players a game finally balanced, where defenders have the same power of attackers. The spectacular and televised identity of the franchise, though, is always the same, but this comes as a silent revolution which, if not muted after a couple of match in the name of metagame and pro gaming, it could be a great start for the future.                            
85	                                FIFA 22 is the most enjoyable football title in years thanks to revamped player AI and gameplay mechanics that offer unprecedented realism on the pitch. Off the pitch, EA still has some work to do, but new additions to Career Mode and match days somewhat make up for Ultimate Team’s egregious tactics.                            
85	                                If you've been avoiding FIFA for a long time, this edition is a great opportunity to change that and play some matches on virtual stadiums. If you're a regular, on the other hand, you're probably playing as we speak, but this time, you're probably fully satisfied. Right?                             
84	                                As the sum of its parts, FIFA 22 is the best FIFA in years…and plays a strong game of football on the PS5. The decision to go more sim-heavy is long overdue, with finally a befitting pace and defensive posture to the beautiful game. Online contests – even with exploits via microtransaction supercharged players – are much more balanced. There’s so much to do both online and offline, it’s an easy recommendation for both casual and committed football fanatics.                            
84	                                FIFA 22 kicks-off of the football season with a renewed edition, with the much-awaited Hypermotion Technology playing the leading role. The (numerous) new animations shine above all, while the gameplay has a slightly lower pace, with skills playing a lesser role. An interesting choice, that works quite well despite some issues (goalkeepers) that we hope will be fixed as soon as possible. As always, there is a rich choice of game modes, with a range of options able to satisfy both those looking for a quick & simple experience and those looking for a challenge that can last for months... or even until the release of FIFA 23.                            
84	                                FIFA 22 is the improvement that many fans have been waiting for. Shifting the focus away from pace, the game has managed to achieve a new level of realism. Due to HyperMotion Technology, players act and move intelligently, increasing strategic possibilities in offensive and defensive scenarios. With a litany of tweaks and refinements, FIFA 22 is the best iteration of the sport in the franchise.                            
83	                                EA delivered a solid soccer game that you should enjoy beyond a simple online match. Both Pro Clubs and Volta received solid upgrades and the created players have an interesting development thanks to the improvements that you can implement in them. Overall, the game mechanics have been polished enough to feel that this year FIFA 22 is very different from other previous deliveries.                            
83	                                FIFA 22 is a step in the right direction. It can never be in the best, because for that we would have to see changes in FUT's micropayments, but we do see a huge effort to make matches more realistic and a great job to add novelties to the title's various modes.                            
81	                                As a football game, FIFA 22 is very continuist. It doesn’t offer anything spectacular or revolutionary in order to make you stand up from your seat, but it takes profit of its previous knowledge to provide some nice matches.                            
80	                                After the poor reception of eFootball and the good result obtained by FIFA 22, thanks to realistic changes in the gameplay, FIFA is now the king of soccer games.                            
80	                                FIFA 22 makes the leap to the new generation in a conservative way, with slight changes in its gameplay that lay the foundations of what the saga may become in the future. Lovers of football simulators will enjoy its fast pace and large amount of content.                             
80	                                FIFA 22 is an undeniably fantastic football game, once you get on the pitch. HyperMotion Technology, and a push for enhanced visuals, physics, and more, make this an incredibly tactical experience and closer to the real thing than ever before. The inevitable problem is when you look at the insidious inclusions off the pitch, such as FUT, which - while somewhat more generous with the in-game currency - is still incredibly predatory and push on the in-game gambling mechanics.                            
80	                                A refreshingly realistic take on the game of football and tons of content should be enough for fans to dive once again in the virtual stadiums of FIFA. However, Ultimate Team remains the gaming industry's most aggressively toxic loot box environment. Also, that precious next-gen feeling will have to wait.                            
80	                                If you're playing on current-gen systems, FIFA 22 may be a bit of a harder sell. The game itself is largely the same as last year, It's the next-gen graphics and gameplay that really make the game stand out. On next-gen, it's a must for longtime FIFA players. For everyone else, it's more of a personal choice. You certainly won't be missing out on much if you wait a little while.                            
80	                                The most important question of all is: how does FIFA 22 play? Well, for the most part just like FIFA 21 and 20. And that's a good thing, because its controls and gameplay were fine. Revolutionary changes you should not expect. The next-gen versions have received a graphical update and load super fast, but razor-sharp and lifelike movements during a full soccer match will not be available until next year at the earliest.                            
80	                                While EA continues to leave no stone unturned when it comes to bringing football to gamers, it would be wrong of us to condone the lootbox mechanics that still dominate the Ultimate Team mode. But if you're happy to swerve that and just stick to regular matches, and the game's two enormous career modes, then FIFA still sets the bar incredibly high for football games and indeed sports games everywhere.                            
80	                                Great additions to Career mode and Volta, with the overhauled animations introduced by the new HyperMotion technology make it the best FIFA game in years. FUT is still marred by microtransactions making the game somewhat unfair, but the rest of the game has improved for the better.                            
80	                                As good an entry as we’ve seen in recent years, FIFA 22 is a step in the right direction for EA Sports’ oft-faltering series and has laid a foundation for what will hopefully be positive changes going forward.                            
80	                                FIFA 22 actually feels different from the rest of the franchise, but it's still the same old game. New movement mechanics open up new strategies of scoring, but the AI still feels pretty dumb sometimes. Overall, it's a solid soccer experience that fans likely wont's miss out.                            
80	                                Fifa 22 is absolutely unmistakably a Fifa game – it has the sophistication and polish we’ve come to expect, with all the player likenesses, authentic stadia and recognisable commentators we see every year. But right at the core of it is a match engine that feels more surefooted than ever, at a time when the game’s more tactically complex rival Pro Evolution Soccer has been relegated to a free-to-play existence with all the compromises that will inevitably entail. If you can live with the loot-box trickery of Ultimate Team, this is a gigantic, rewarding simulation that offers a ton of variety and scope, and many, many moments of exquisite goalmouth drama.                            
80	                                Depending on its edition, FIFA 22 is either the leap into a new generation - of more or less the same ... or the annual insolence.                            
80	                                FIFA 22 has focussed squarely on the on-pitch action and has succeeded in creating the best pure football game from the series in quite some time. For me, at least, there is no better measure.                            
80	                                FIFA 22 is packed with all the usual modes you’d expect from the yearly iteration, but this time there have been significant improvements to the on-field action. A more inclusive game than ever, making use of the grunt of the latest console hardware, it’s a joy to experience whether you’re a fan of the biggest club, or just enjoy spending the evenings with mates chatting and playing.                            
80	                                Unlike last years release, there aren't too many noticable issues that need improving on either. EA have been afforded more time to get this game to where they need it to be, and they seem to have done exactly that. On the other hand though, there are still modes with untapped potential that EA have to put more focus on in order to appeal to their full market of players. It's a strong release from EA, one which will keep them at the top of the footballing sim market, but without a leading competitor to challenge them, that isn't awfully difficult.                            
80	                                FIFA 22 presented several improvements to the various modes, yet, we are still waiting for EA to make bolder changes.                            
80	                                FIFA 22 feels like the foundation for the future of FIFA. It still a great game, with no big improvements, but very fun to play.                            
80	                                FIFA 22 feels like real football, and it’s all the better for it. Impressive improvements to player positioning, ball physics, and animations make for a supremely satisfying simulation that underpins each of the franchise’s flagship modes. Career Mode doesn’t reinvent the wheel, but the ability to create a club is entertaining, and the changes to Player Careers are overdue. Microtransactions still rule supreme in Ultimate Team, and you’ll already have your own personal opinions on that, but there’s so much to do in this year’s release that you could easily invest hundreds of hours into it without seeing a single loot box.                            
80	                                FIFA has changed its face. It's bigger, more realistic, and more jaw-dropping than ever before but it seems to have left behind one important factor: fun.                            
80	                                While FIFA 22's gameplay is still great, its flashy qualities make it fun to watch, and Career Mode & Volta offer some much-needed variety, its core experience feels a little too similar to previous generations of gaming. That's a problem EA will need to solve moving forward.                            
78	                                The EA Sports revolution comes to life in FIFA 22 for next gen, but in our opinion we are facing a starting point and certainly not a goal for Canadian football. The innovations guaranteed by Hypermotion Technology, a real pillar of this year's offer, give the scenic impact and gameplay a realism that is unprecedented for the series. Unfortunately, the refinement in the animations and the artificial intelligence tricks clash with the idea of ​​football that Electronic Arts has been repeating for a decade now: spectacular and frenetic, but too fast and not very inclined to strategy. In addition to the technical improvements, there is a content offer that has never been so rich and complex, but in large part a little too anchored to the past. In short, FIFA is heading towards excellence again without fully achieving it: it begins to transform its beating heart, but not its own head. And for a champion to become a champion, it is necessary to have both.                             
77	                                Despite a full year since the launch of the new console generation, FIFA 22 doesn't offer anything groundbreaking, on or off the pitch. The changes are largely minor and exclusive features are not worth fretting over. It plays a solid game of football, as always, but we're still left waiting for a true next-gen leap.                            
77	                                FIFA 22 has achieved a successful acceleration with its HyperMotion feature and new dynamics. But despite all these innovations, it can barely get rid of the "same game" feeling.                            
77	                                FIFA 22 could be a new beginning for the series thanks to a better football sensation. The gameplay is smooth, slower and fun. Sadly, many of its mode still lack that extra edge to feel different from FIFA 21.                            
75	                                EA Sports has delivered a strong next-gen experience with FIFA 22. The primary focus was on gameplay and the attention led to a tangible improvement overall. However, the feature set is still in need of more layers.                            
75	                                We're still waiting for EA to reinvent the wheel and shock us with a refreshing take on virtual football. And while we're doing that, we can enjoy FIFA 22, which once more offers more of the same, adding some tweaks and an extra layer of graphical fidelity. The latter is the main attraction this time, thanks to the brand new HyperMotion technology.                            
75	                                The gameplay has therefore managed to take the train of the new generation while the content of FIFA 22, far from the references of the sports genre, is still blocked in the 2010s.                             
74	                                Overall, FIFA 22 is the best new entry in recent years. But the nefarious gutting of play-to-win rewards in its most popular mode means that the shadow of pay-to-win microtransactions looms ever more over FIFA's latest entry.                            
70	                                FIFA 22 upgrades graphics but loses some licences, and an overall experience feels like a “win some-lose some” type of product. While some of the new modes and technical upgrades make it a refreshing entry, it’s starting to be painfully obvious that the series needs some serious calibration in order to get back on the path of old glory.                            
70	                                While not the breath of fresh air many hoped for, FIFA 22 manages to at least improve the experience of FIFA 21. Ultimate Team still has its intrinsic issues, but manages to make itself more appealing thanks to less-infuriating gameplay and a less-punishing Division Rivals system.                             
70	                                A slower-paced FIFA creates absorbing action that feels like a step forward for the series, but the dominance of FUT is becoming less and less inspiring. [Issue#7, p.76]                            
70	                                As always, new FIFA game tries to fix the problems of its predecessors, while making the necessary updates to the core gameplay, in this case, turning FIFA 22 into more methodical and realistic game.                            
70	                                After last year's debacle, Fifa 22 is fortunately taking another step in the right direction. It's far from the level of Fifa 10 or the best parts of the previous generation, but at least it looks like football again.                             
70	                                FIFA 22 adds a lot of improvements going the right way towards a true simulation of football. Yet, the aging frostbite engine spoils these additions and the FUT mode is keeping its arcade grip on the whole gameplay.                            
70	                                There are a number of welcome changes in FIFA 22. The gameplay is more rewarding and the animations are finally interesting. There’s more intricacy to build-up play and often a much more satisfying finish. But there’s also no getting around the large number of bugs, the fairly modest improvements in various game modes and the continued focus on paying to win in FUT. FIFA 22 is certainly more Europa Conference League than Champions League.                             
70	                                For as much as FIFA 22 has done right with enhancements to the the on-field product, they seem perfectly content to not offer up new ways to engage with the sport. While HyperMotion helps bridge the realism gap that’s been present for a bit, it isn’t quite substantial enough to warrant calling it game-changing. This may be a positive step in the right direction for the franchise, but it’s still quite a ways from genuinely raising the bar.                            
70	                                FIFA 22 proves that EA’s soccer simulator is still the most playable of the genre in the market, but it also demonstrates that they know it. Yet again, the blatant disregard for industry-wide skepticism over microtransactions reigns this year in FIFA. Though there are long-awaited improvements to Career Mode and sharp graphical enhancements, it is hard to see past the decision to continue rinsing the most dedicated players of their cash.                            
70	                                Doing better than FIFA 21 was inevitable for FIFA 22. And the task has been accomplished, between a pleasant interface to handle, an ever more addicting Ultimate Team mode and more defensive gameplay this time around. But some flaws persist, others have emerged and overall the container remains the same from year to year. If EA has made the choice to reform the form this season, and under conditions that the patches improve and do not destroy what has been put in place, the developer will have to urgently look at the substance, which needs to be fleshed out.                             
70	                                Microtransactions still loom large, but small iterative changes and the horsepower of new-gen consoles combine to make FIFA 22 feel like a worthwhile upgrade without needing anything revolutionary or terribly exciting from EA’s side.                             
70	                                FIFA 22 is a fundamentally better experience than the one we've had in the past four years, but it is still a fundamentally flawed experience. The HyperMotion system isn't always competent, but the new ball physics, as well as a slower gameplay, make this entry much worthier of the "simulation" label.                            
70	                                A superb second next-gen season on the digital turf – but subtle Ultimate Team tweaks amplify the ‘pay to win’ criticisms that stalk this series annually.                            
60	                                It is hard to recommend buying FIFA at all this year. Like no other yearly release in the franchise, FIFA 22 is a game of thin margins.                            
60	                                FIFA 22 offers a lot of new elements on next-gen. Gameplay is finally going in a clear direction and provides a clear picture of what to expect from this iteration of FIFA. Even though the gameplay finally seems fine, there are quite a few problems. Career is near unplayable thanks to loads of bugs and glitches, Ultimate Team is still a pay-to-win fest and a lot of modes are clearly less important than cash cow Ultimate Team, which is understandable, but still frustrating.                            
90	                                Although it has its shortcomings, I’ve been really impressed with FIFA 22. EA has delivered one of the most in-depth career modes to date, and the new additions across the game’s other modes are most welcome. I do hope to see more iteration across the board, but the gameplay this year feels top notch. It’s a huge step forward for the series, and a proper showcase of what the new consoles are capable of.                            
88	                                FIFA 22 is a clear step forward in the franchise, thanks mainly to the arrival of much-needed changes. It still misses a generational leap, but it is undoubtedly a great football game.                            
87	                                FIFA 22 introduces welcome new features such as the Hypermotion technology, a more balanced gameplay and improvements in several modes, but it fails to get rid of some historical flaws that now clash more with the improvements received. The result is, as always, a football title of the highest caliber, both on the technical front and in terms of pure fun, but we start to feel the need for a more marked change of pace to really push the saga into the new generation.                            
85	                                FIFA 22 offers the franchise an exciting start to life on Xbox Series X|S and PS5, with drastically improved gameplay. Complementary features aside in Career, Pro Clubs, and Ultimate Team, that was the dealbreaker and with Hypermotion Technology, EA Sports has delivered.                            
85	                                FIFA 22 is a further leap towards realism in soccer titles. The inclusion of Hypermotion not only improves the staging of the game, but also translates to the field. In addition, improvements in ball physics and additions to the different game modes make FIFA 22 a more satisfying game than the previous title in the series.                            
84	                                FIFA 22 improves things where they were needed and is the first actual next-gen FIFA.                            
80	                                With the inclusion of HyperMotion technology, FIFA 22 on Xbox Series X|S is in the best shape it has been for years. HyperMotion may sound very buzz-wordy – and it is – but it also fundamentally changes the action on the pitch into something very much resembling real-life football. Tweaks and changes will be made as the season progresses but right now, this is one of the best launches a FIFA game has ever had.                            
80	                                It feels strange to have to say this, but FIFA 22 is a sports game made with love, whose developers have obviously rediscovered the joy behind how a football sim should behave. The changes to gameplay and graphics, and the evolutions of established modes, give it the largest scope yet for a football sim - perhaps any sports game, ever. And it pays off. FIFA 22 is the most streamlined, self-aware and ultimately enjoyable FIFA title in years and makes a strong case for being its altogether best entry. It's just about the shakeup that the fans have been asking for for a long time, and it's a pleasure to say it's well worth playing for the next year.                            
80	                                We're pleasantly surprised by FIFA 22 on Xbox Series X. The franchise had a good first outing on next-gen consoles last year, but the gameplay has really been taken up a notch this time around, seemingly proving that "Hypermotion Technology" isn't just another throwaway buzzword. It's not perfect, and there are certain areas off the pitch that we wish could have received even more attention, but this is the best FIFA has been in quite a few years, and we just hope it isn't ruined by unnecessary gameplay patches down the line.                            
80	                                Fifa 22 for the new generation of consoles is a big step forward for both the series and Electronic Arts. The realism is more noticeable this time, while the ball game on the field is more convincing. Sure, there are occasional misses in places, but for the most part, everything from animations to collisions feels completely worthy of the epithet "next generation".                             
80	                                FIFA 22 offers a slower, more deliberate game of football on the pitch, and that's a good thing. But with minimal investment in new modes or updates to existing ones, this is a good upgrade, rather than an essential one.                            
80	                                FIFA 22 makes some important changes on and off the pitch, and though there's still plenty of room for improvement, it's still the series' best game in recent years.                            
80	                                FIFA 22 incorporates enough novelties in its game system to vary the rhythm of the matches and improve the experience. A great simulator, punctuated by the importance of microtransactions and the absence of major developments in its different modalities.                            
80	                                FIFA 22 is just like any other FIFA game. It’s a very, very good football game, and with NBA 2K taking its eyes off the prize in favour of the State Farm drip, it’s left with a tap-in to be 2021’s best sports sim. HyperMotion makes a difference, create-a-club adds some personality, and everything else is the same. What more were you expecting?                            
80	                                On the whole, though, the value for money here is ludicrous and every mode provides a different slice of footballing simulation goodness. Beyond all that, though: FIFA 22 is just a fun time! The game will change with patches eventually, but right now it is the best launch FIFA has ever been. It leaves you with a smile at every small touch and with a satisfied feeling and you ping a cross-field ball. FIFA has finally brought it home!                            
80	                                FIFA 22 evolved its engine and its core game modes, but the feeling on the pitch is almost the same. The gameplay is very attack-oriented and fast: FIFA fans are going to love it, football fans, maybe, would love to slow it down and try a more tactical experience.                            
80	                                FIFA 22 is the best in the series to date, even if its revamped animation isn't as revolutionary as billed. As a standalone title it's fantastic, even though avid players will likely feel that changes are negligible compared to last year.                            
75	                                The gameplay has therefore managed to take the train of the new generation while the content of FIFA 22, far from the references of the sports genre, is still blocked in the 2010s.                             
70	                                FIFA 22 adds some big improvements to the way the game functions, and better yet, makes the game feel even better as you play. Add to that some big changes to modes like Career Mode, and FIFA 22 is a huge improvement from past entries.                            
70	                                Overall, FIFA 22 is more or less what you'd expect from the latest title in such a series. In some areas it impresses, while in others it falls short. The visuals look better than ever and the accessibility options are relatively varied, but the imagery doesn't always hold up and the removal of the single-player mode 'The Journey' seems like a misstep from the developers. While it may not feel as innovative as previous instalments, FIFA 22 is still a worthy sports game that scratches your football itch.                             
70	                                FIFA 22 might tout next-gen visuals and solid gameplay, but there aren't enough exciting changes to differentiate it from last year's experience.                            
50	                                Fifa 22 struggles with a massive identity-crisis. Does it want to be a realistic football simulation or as spectacular as possible? The result is rather disappointing. A soulless football game in which every game feels like a match for the Johan Cruijff cup: you can win it, but it really isn't about anything at all.                            
80	                                While not all of the features Battlefield 2042 introduces are a hit, and the lack of a single-player component is a little disappointing, the game still manages to deliver the same spectacular skirmishes fans of the series crave with its explosive 128-player conflicts and satisfying selection of near-future weaponry and gadgets. Add to that the impressive Portal Mode, which has the potential to keep a steady stream of community-created content flowing, and Battlefield 2042 could very well keep your itchy trigger finger soothed for the foreseeable future. Whether you’re a longtime fan of the franchise looking to dominate the leaderboards or a greenhorn ready for your first tour of duty, Battlefield 2042 delivers something worth fighting for.                            
70	                                Battlefield 2042 had all the right cards to offer an incredible experience - huge maps, more players (bots included), destructive weather events and the promising Portal mode. It is, however, unfortunately incomplete due to technical glitches, missing features and senseless design choices. The potential to become one of the best episodes of the saga is there, but it will take time and many corrective updates.                            
70	                                Battlefield 2042 has a great technical section and is really fun, but the lack of content makes it an empty title at launch.                            
70	                                Overall, a decent shooter that feels a little too overblown for its own good. It’s best elements lie in the past but there’s plenty here to get your teeth into and potentially dozens of hours of multiplayer fun for the winter months.                            
70	                                Battlefield 2042 is far from perfect, but it isn’t bad. It’s fun to fight and it’s great to be able to drive vehicles across huge maps. Hell, it’s even enjoyable to crash a jet into some unsuspecting soldier on the ground. There are bugs, but patches are planned so hope should be held. In the meantime, Battlefield Portal is almost worth the price of admission itself.                              
70	                                What Battlefield 2042 does well, it does really well, but it sometimes can’t help but be held down under the weight of its own scale.                            
70	                                Battlefield 2042 has everything you want as a Battlefield fan: destruction, levolution, and carnage. But while it’s fun to play, it is clear that Battlefield 2042 is DICE’s most ambitious Battlefield yet - and it hasn’t quite come off in the way many were expecting.                             
70	                                Battlefield 2042 is a bit of a mixed bag as things stand right now with the excellent Portal mode overshadowing almost everything else on offer. The futuristic large-scale battles are spectacular stuff, for sure, but it's all a little disjointed so far with the all-new Specialists underlining a feeling that solo soldiering has somehow taken precedent over the series' signature teamwork. There's still plenty to enjoy in this meaty package for early adopters, and we've no doubt DICE will be busy improving things as the months roll on but, outside of a mode that celebrates the series' history more than it embraces what's new in this latest entry, what's here struggles to feel absolutely essential at launch.                            
60	                                Right now, Battlefield 2042 is offering plenty of new features and gameplay elements that will benefit the series’ veteran players, although I’m not sure if there is enough there to hold the attention of players that don’t already have a vested interest in it, at least while they wait for the various problems to be fixed. That really is a shame because even though the persistent issues are frustrating, unnecessary, and annoying, underneath it all is a game that is brimming with potential, and one that I’m enjoying much of my time with — combat is tense, challenging, and unpredictable, and it offers the very best Battlefield experience in recent years... when it hits right.                            
60	                                Battlefield 2042 isn't a bad shooter, but to release in this quarter of this year it really needed to bring its A-game, and it hasn't done that.                            
58	                                Battlefield has had some shaky launches in the past, and there’s no reason not to think that things will eventually be smoothed over in Battlefield 2042 over time. However, Battlefield 2042 is also weighed down by design issues and missing features. You’re going to want to wait on this one, and even then give some thought to skipping this iteration in the series.                            
40	                                Battlefield 2042 is a pretty huge disappointment. And it's hard to think if there's was a way to make things even worse. It would be great if instead of this game EA would just make a full re-release of Bad Company 2 and Battlefield 3 - the consoles userbase would surely appreciate the the move.                            
40	                                It's not as unsalvageable as Battlefield 5, but it's still hard to imagine this evolving into the definitive Battlefield game that DICE wants it to be. There is fleeting fun to be had here, but it's often spoiled by the game's blatant shortcomings. The maps are a slog, gunplay is bogged down by puzzling design choices, and there's no shortage of bugs that actively require the player to restart the entire game. It's a far cry from the 10-year-old Battlefield 3 and as it continues to age, the series strays further away from those glory days with no road to redemption in sight.                            
100	                                Battlefield 2042 brings the sandbox back to the series in bold and controversial ways. The new Specialist system might seem like sacrilege at first, but it opens up gameplay opportunities that weren’t possible in previous titles. The massive, well-designed maps offer plenty of room for experimentation and emergent stories, and the modes are a blast. And that’s just All-Out Warfare. Between that, Hazard Zone, and the expansive Battlefield Portal, Battlefield 2042 has something for everyone, without feeling like it’s stretched too thin. It’s a true evolution of the series, one that pushes back against a stagnation that threatened the series’ future. It won’t be for everyone, but for players who crave imagination and fun from their Battlefields, it will give them everything that they crave and more.                            
90	                                Battlefield 2042 is an excellent effort and filled with a ton of competitive multiplayer content at launch with much more planned in the near future. There are some technical issues such as respawns and visual bugs to sort out, and some game modes and specialists might need some tweaks, but DICE is off to a great start and Battlefield 2042 should likely be relevant and popular for years to come.                            
90	                                What Battlefield 2042 lacks in a single-player campaign, it makes up for in the sheer amount of content that it delivers to fans from all generations of the series. It’s a walk down memory lane that provides hours of that Battlefield action that you’d expect. You may have to spend a few of those understanding the UI and gun customization features, but with the inclusion of Hazard Zone and Portal, the possibilities of enjoyment here are endless.                            
90	                                All in all, these are minor points to one of the best Battlefields we’ve had in a while. It’s rekindled my excitement for the series for sure. With new modes like Hazard Zone and the ability to play old games like Bad Company 2 remastered, the game is full of content, even without single-player. If you’ve been thinking of diving into BF, whether it is your return or a first in the series, Battlefield 2042 might be exactly what you were looking for.                              
90	                                Battlefield 2042 does everything expected of it and more. Not content with fully succeeding in its traditional multi-pan, this opus has the luxury of offering additional gigantic and highly qualitative content to players. Portal mode seems ready to keep all of its promises and allow the creation of various modes whether they are crazy or competitive. Hazard Zone, on the other hand, succeeds in unexpected situations and offers a particularly successful reading of the game in squads. Beautiful as a truck, generous, modular and damn fun to play, 2042 is neither more nor less than one of the best games of the license.                             
90	                                Being online-only, Battlefield 2042 had to make up for its lack of any single-player content whatsoever with a variety of worthwhile online content. The game’s developers have not only succeeded in that regard, but they have gone above and beyond. All-Out Warfare is a fantastic evolution on the classic Battlefield experience, modernizing the franchise with more scale, spectacle, and ways to play than ever before. Battlefield Portal and Hazard Zone likewise shine in their own regards, with the former proving that it can serve as the base for players to create their own unique experiences within 2042. If any future Battlefield title omits these two modes, I might consider them incomplete.                            
90	                                Battlefield 2042 is a brave new chapter in the history of the series, full of interesting elements and very well done in many respects. Between the evolution of total warfare, the addition of Hazard Zone and the innovative Portal editor, DICE has done things big, and big is the passion that lies behind this new, monumental shooter.                            
85	                                While the lack of a single-player campaign is a hard pill to swallow, Battlefield 2042 really has others strong arguments. Be able to play with 128 players in the Conquest and Breakthrough modes is obviously very good news, the game  becoming more "massively multiplayer" and more spectacular, helped in this by an always impressive Frostbite engine.                            
85	                                It’s not without its issues, but Battlefield 2042 is off to a fantastic start for DICE’s beloved series. All-Out Warfare modes are immersive, Hazard Zone is enjoyable while Battlefield Portal steals the show. There’s a lot to love here, and I’m excited to see where the game goes.                            
84	                                Battlefield 2042 skips the campaign and sticks to what it does best: deep, fun multiplayer. The 128 player figure (on PC and next gen) ensures the most spectacular battles in the series, and we love Battlefield Portal's nods to previous installments. The analyzed version had some minor bugs.                             
83	                                Battlefield 2042 is a fun and bold experience that shows that DICE really knows how to please shooter games fans.                            
80	                                Battlefield 2042 makes gutsy changes to a series that needed them, and sets a new standard for built-in custom mode support.                            
80	                                Expectations for Battlefield 2042 were high, very high. Unfortunately, the game has not yet been able to fully satisfy them at the start. Problems range from balancing issues in Hazard Zone mode to the lack of standard features such as an in-game voice chat. Any yet: In hardly any other DICE shooter have we experienced such entertaining, exciting and completely crazy multiplayer matches. In order to survive within the contested multiplayer market, DICE now has to optimize the fundamentally strong pillars of Battlefield 2042 step by step.                            
80	                                Battlefield 2042 brings us a package full of excitement and thrill in the modern Warfare of the near future and a blast from the past with Portal mode despite some technical issues you may encounter along the way which is pretty easy to forget once you’re immersed in the gameplay.                            
80	                                Whether it's the number of weapons or maps, the quantities are more than enough for the release of Battlefield. It is rare to change weapons; once you find your "heart" weapon, you never let go of it, except for a few exceptions. Battlefield 2042 has a bright future ahead of it due to the developers' complete coverage of the game for a full year. If players feel that there is a lack of content, remember that seasons will bring new game modes, new maps, but also new specialists. Hazard Zone and Portal mode are a welcome boost to the license, and it's great to see that Battlefield is still able to deliver new and exciting content.                            
80	                                Battlefield 2042 is clearly a good vintage. Let it be said, it's very pleasant to get your hands on such a generous opus. The developers of DICE and Ripple Effect Studios were keen to please neophytes but also unconditional fans. The recipe works despite a few small problems such as the insufficient number of maps or even some gameplay issues related to specialists, weapon balancing or the spacialization of footsteps. The title being keen to expand via its future Battlepass, it will be necessary to judge the content over the long term to see whether or not the content is up to par. But as it stands, we are facing a Battlefield worthy of the name.                             
80	                                Battlefield 2042 feels like a game made specifically for Battlefield fans.  Multiplayer is fast-paced and chaotic, and while new modes like Hazard Zone and Portal are a mixed bag, they provide an excellent foundation for the game to build on going forward.                            
80	                                The biggest and boldest Battlefield to date, 2042 combines trademark action with impressive innovations. Experimentation with loadout and attachment changes drive the enormous spectacle of 128 player warzones and dynamic weather events. Hazard Zone provides the grounds for extremely tactical gameplay but needs refinement to make it a lasting experience. The shining star without question is Portal, allowing series veterans to jump back into their favourite legacy maps and muck around with creative modes and features – it's basically four games in one package. If it wasn't for a few poorly designed 2042 maps, combat balancing issues, and performance concerns, Battlefield 2042 might be the best in the franchise.                            
80	                                A great shooter, Battlefield 2042 offers an even bigger all-out war, staying true to the tenets that made the series popular.                            
80	                                The franchise is back, and this time with a slightly different approach. No single player, and the focus is on large scale battles and creating your own experiences in Battlefield Portal. This works out well, as the unprecedented scale and dynamic gameplay is very good. It is also more accessible than ever before, and that is just the tip of the iceberg. Hazard Zone mode is also a valuable addition, and the possibilities with Portal are endless. All good news, but keep in mind that there will be bugs, unstable frame rates and lag. In other words, the basis is very good, but it can still use some polishing.                            
80	                                Heading in a multiplayer-only direction, 2042 offers a unique blend of experiences that combines classic Battlefield sensibilities with fresh new ideas, making for a game filled with exciting content to explore whether you’re a returning veteran or a series newbie.                            
78	                                Battlefield 2042 is a gorgeous FPS but it fails to provide a polished and deep experience that we expect from a premium AAA game.                            
78	                                Battlefield 2042 is proof that the classics it incorporates through Portal offer a better image of the essence of the saga compared to the All-Out Warfare experience.                            
75	                                Battlefield 2042 immediately shows enormous potential, fueled by a playful structure that hosts very thick modes and truly promising innovations. Unfortunately, DICE's latest work is also one of the most disorganized chapters of the series, as spectacular as it is strewn with imbalances and lightness, which affect the choral rendering of an offer that still fails to give the best of itself.                             
75	                                Overall, there isn’t much content to even write about with Battlefield 2042. There’s 7 maps in the base game (this doesn’t include the 6 maps available in Portal, because those are just direct pulls from their respective original games), and 3 game modes to choose from. The game is enjoyable, but it doesn’t do much to stand out from the last few iterations of the series and without a campaign, feels like it’s lacking in content. Hopefully some updates and adjustments can help clear up some of the issues I experienced, especially with the balancing in the Breakthrough mode. As it stands, if you’re looking for just more Battlefield, but with a different setting, this is a good option. If you’ve not been a big fan of Battlefield in the past, or at least in the recent past entries, I don’t think they’ve changed enough here to change your mind.                            
75	                                If you’re a longtime Battlefield fan or just seeking a new FPS to get lost in, there’s a great deal of fun to be had here. But in its current state, 2042 falls just short of being one of the best multiplayer titles in recent years.                            
75	                                Battlefield 2042 has not become the Battlefield to end all Battlefields that some hoped for. Hopefully most players can see the game for what it is: a decent modern multiplayer shooter and a fickle DIY kit.                             
71	                                Battlefield 2042 contains a great multiplayer shooter sandbox that isburied under half-baked game design, bugs and performance issues.                            
70	                                What's really impressive in Battlefield 2042 is the variety that's on offer. It lets you play a bunch of different kinds of FPS experiences--in different game modes, in different Portal rule sets, and even in the same match as you switch between characters. Portal lets you relive the Battlefield games of the past, but on the 2042 side, DICE has cherry-picked from popular trends like hero shooters and battle royales. The best part is that, mostly, it has done a really effective job of curating those additions so that they bring more to what players already like about Battlefield, rather than change what already works.                            
70	                                Battlefield 2042 is inconsistent. The maps and vehicular combat are top tier, while the specialists and redesigned scorecard diminish teamwork. Hazard Zone does its best to offset these issues, but playing without a dedicated squad can be tricky. Portal opens the window to what could be a brighter future for the franchise, and hopefully DICE adds meaningful updates to the service at a steady rate. Battlefield 2042 has a long and windy road ahead, and only time will define its lasting legacy. As of this moment, all but the most dedicated veterans should probably wait and see how things shake out.                            
70	                                Battlefield 2042 has the potential to be a fantastic Battlefield game, but its server problems really put a damper on it. At this point, wait for a couple more patches before checking it out.                            
70	                                Lots of things in Battlefield 2042 does not work the way it's supposed to. There's a lot of issues, and that's to be expected, unfortunately. Still, the foundations are solid, and if everything worked well, the final grade would be higher. After a few months of fixes, the game will work better. However, even now, I'm having tons of fun.                            
70	                                Battlefield 2042's highpoint is its powerful Portal mode, which lets you relive the series' past glories and tweak them to your liking. Its current batch of modes is overstuffed with players and utter chaos, though Hazard Zone scales things down in an interesting, high-stakes way.                            
70	                                Battlefield 2042 is the result of an attempted offensive on multiple fronts. All-out War is the major victim of this strategy with several questionable design issues that detract from the experience. Hazard Zone is a solid mode that plays it safe, without risking the formula established by other games, while Portal shines by bringing back the best moments of the old Battlefield games. Made with longevity in mind, Dice has an uphill battle with Battlefield 2042.                            
70	                                Battlefield 2042 has a lot of problems. From its optimization, questionable design, and various bugs, it is clear that this game was not completely ready to be released. Yet despite all of that, I have still found myself having a good time bathing in the chaotic fun that is Battlefield. It needs some patches for sure, but Battlefield 2042 is by no means a lost cause.                            
70	                                Battlefield 2042 should have been a massive, triumphant return for the series but, as much as it scratches that itch for both small and large scale combat, it brings some unnecessary changes to its core formula while missing the mark with some of its ambitious new features. With enough support, the great first-person shooter underneath might fully surface in a few months’ time, but properly enjoying it at launch requires jumping through several hoops.                            
70	                                Battlefield 2042 is a strong foundation for future expansion. DICE's multiplayer-only FPS has scale and spectacle, but there are elements in need of careful refinement and optimization.                             
70	                                Battlefield 2042 had the Matchball against Call of Duty in 2021. When Fans were disappointed about the first look on Vanguard, Battlefield came as the Savior. But they dropped the Ball. Battlefield 2042 is a good game with great moments, but behind every new design decision is a big, fat “BUT”. The new Specialists are a great way to diversify the Gameplay and gives freedom to the players, BUT they kill the Teamplay with this new freedom. Hazard Zone has some great moments in it, BUT the devs forgot motivational systems for gamers to play it long time. The Gameplay is a good mix of the best Battlefields, BUT there are bugs all over the place. That’s all things that can be managed with patches and content updates in the future, but that should not be the standard for a release version. If DICE and EA would have delayed Battlefield 2042 maybe for six months, they could have made a masterpiece. Now it’s another blow in the buggy reputation of the franchise.                            
70	                                This near-future sequel has all the components it needs to become a classic entry in the multiplayer series, but it feels like 2042 is many updates away from reaching its full potential.                            
70	                                Quotation forthcoming.                            
70	                                Battlefield 2042 has a strong core and has the potential to be one of the best games in the series. However, balancing quirks, performance issues, and some fundamental design decisions are holding it back from true greatness.                            
70	                                Battlefield 2042 should have been a triumphant return of the franchise and developer. In some respects, Battlefield 2042 delivers on its promises thanks to fantastic gameplay, a suite of new features and improvements, and a presentation that looks as good as it plays. Unfortunately, the game falls short just as much, if not more.                            
60	                                Up to 128 players, regardless of whether they play on PC, PS5 or Xbox Series, can take on each other online at the same time in epic battles. Getting that done without too much lag and hiccups is a technical feat and works wonderfully. Too bad the amount of bugs in our test version was too high to make the game really excel.                             
60	                                Battlefield 2042 is a fun enough time, but DICE needs to work hard if it wants to take the unrefined ideas found here and turn it into something that feels like a worthy successor to the Battlefield legacy.                            
60	                                Battlefield 2042 is an ambitious shooter that features the excellent Portal mode-creation tool, as well as a few, cool game types. Unfortunately, technical issues and balance problems mean that you may want to hold off buying the game until EA Dice irons out the kinks.                            
60	                                Battlefield 2042 wants so many things that it succeeds at almost none of them. There's a good game buried beneath it all, but you'll wade through a lot of sludge to get there.                            
60	                                After spending time with each of the three modes in Battlefield 2042, none of them are worth purchasing the game for in its current state. All-Out Warfare loses focus of what makes Battlefield games fun and feels lethargic to play. Hazard Zone feels like an afterthought that’s merely included as a box-checking exercise. Portal shows the most promise, but mostly serves as a bittersweet reminder of how great the series once was.                            
60	                                There's a good game to be found within the Battlefield 2042 and fun to be had as the spectacle of Battlefield's signature gameplay is taken to new, more expansive heights, but it's marred by a handful of unsuccessful gameplay design changes, hurriedly implemented features and bugs at launch.                             
60	                                Battlefield 2042‘s biggest problem is it tries to deliver power to the players at the expense of everything else. However, when every player is exceptional all of the time, the end result is that everything just appears altogether ordinary. Beautiful graphics and some incredibly well-done remakes of earlier games can’t stop this Battlefield from being a disappointment.                            
55	                                When Battlefield 2042 hits, it sparkles in explosive mayhem. The three different pillars of the multiplayer shooter each have their own potential, but are each plagued by feelings of 'just not' — or rather: 'not yet'. Be it the many technical defects or the sometimes ill-considered game elements: Battlefield 2042 leaves a lot to the service component to further polish things up.                             
50	                                Battlefield 2042 has a serious identity crisis. It clearly wants to be like Call of Duty: Warzone, with its overreliance on fast-quip Specialists that will serve as mannequins for endless cosmetic microtransactions. It also wants to grab some of the audience who religiously play Hunt: Showdown or Escape from Tarkov with its undercooked Hazard Zone mode. Finally, it also wants to be Battlefield to what’s left of a dedicated fan base that’s been left to watch the franchise chase the tail of its competitors for years. We loved Battlefield because it wasn’t Call of Duty or Counter-Strike or Fortnite or Apex or any other popular shooter. This mismanaged project clearly needed more time in the oven and a cohesive design that works to Battlefield’s strengths rather than a game attempting to be multiple things to multiple audiences. In a year where so many releases have been marred by a lack of polish and bugs, Battlefield 2042 may be the biggest offender.                            
45	                                In a world where developers are getting used to working from home and games are being pushed back due to the global pandemic, EA decided that Battlefield 2042 was ready for this year. It’s not.                            
40	                                I genuinely believe that Battlefield 2042 will one day be the game it's trying to be. It has everything it should need to become a go-to game for me and a group of friends. Right now though, it's just not ready for that mantle. Fixes are desperately needed that can bring Battlefield 2042 to its full potential.                            
40	                                My hope is that we’ll look back at this launch and laugh, remembering that a great game began on such a shoogly peg. For now, the best fun is found in the sideshows. On the main stage of its chaotic 128-player showdowns, it stumbles.                            
40	                                The real lesson here is to stop releasing unfinished games, whether that’s server woes, optimisation issues, immersion-shattering bugs or, as is additionally the case with Battlefield 2042, an undercooked core gameplay offering that would have benefited from at least another year in the oven.                            
40	                                At its best it's action filled and grand in every way, but most of the time you'll struggle with game-breaking bugs or even getting into a match without the game crashing. Hopefully DICE will be able to save this beast with time, but it will demand a lot of  work, and an expansion of its most exciting mode, Battlefield Portal.                            
40	                                It’s hard not to be disappointed with this 2042 offering. You know when the devs said this is a game to “celebrate Battlefield”? They’ve stripped away some of the most fundamental elements of the series and added tornados and Wingsuits to make up for it. It’s Marketing 101. Explosions, tornados, and swooping helicopters look great. One day, they probably will be great. DICE is one of the best when it comes to post-launch patches - for better and for worse. But if you’re on the fence about buying Battlefield 2042, I would just wait. It’s hard for me to condone purchasing what is essentially an unfinished product - an unfinished product with Battle Passes, too. Just wait. It will be a better game in a year’s time. Maybe even six months. If you’ve never played Battlefield and want to experience some of the sheer beauty of 64v64, I say go for it. Just don’t expect an experience that will keep you interested for more than a couple of weeks.                             
30	                                eFootball 2022 isn’t just a bad football game, it’s a bad videogame. It took Konami most of the 2010s to take Pro Evolution Soccer from a mediocre football game to something respectable, and can’t be expected to turn eFootball 2022 around quickly. Playing it sucked all of the enjoyment out of football, and I can’t help but feel it would have been better served being released as a digital pachinko game.                            
30	                                This is a solid football game like the series has always been, but the lack of content and game modes simply means there is nothing to do in this game. You will get bored in a matter of hours.                            
30	                                In PR terms, it's the world's costliest public beta. There's a lithe control system in the wreckage, but it'll take many updates to dig it out.                             
28	                                It's the worst-rated game on Steam for a reason, soccer fans are leftheartbroken.                            
20	                                The game is straight up horrible, and I can’t understand how someone concluded that this was ready for release.                            
20	                                The Pro Evolution Soccer series was all the time a worthy opponent for the popular football simulation FIFA. But the newest game from Konami eFootball 2022 has lost all of its glory of the past. The biggest problem of the title is not the small scope with only two gamemodes, nine licensed clubs and six stadiums, it’s the horrendous gameplay. The switch to the Unreal Engine does absolutely not work for the new football simulation from Konami. There is a lot of work to do in the next weeks, to make this game enjoyable and playable.                             
10	                                eFootball 2022 is a disaster at launch. It's a buggy, unenjoyable mess with limited gameplay options that strip back the core strengths of the PES series, and the fact that it was released in this state at all is shocking. Konami may bring in fixes as it implements further free-to-play updates, but even then, the question over eFootball 2022's worth will still need to be repeatedly asked.                            
80	                                The nostalgic value of this collection is beyond any doubt, they are three masterpieces that today are still very funny (and with a sensational script), but this remastering has fallen short in many respects, and has technical flaws.                             
80	                                Despite the complaints and all, the reality is that Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition is a pretty good remastered of three great PS2 classics. Something important to understand is that this are just remastered with few changes, not remakes.                            
80	                                Even though a new coat of paint can’t cover every imperfection (and creates a couple new ugly streaks in the process), Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy is still a serviceable update for three absolute classics. With the quality of life improvements and visual upgrades, it’s still a fine way to enjoy three amazing games beloved by so many.                            
80	                                GTA Trilogy The Definitive Edition is a worthy remaster (and not a remake, do not confuse) of the classic GTA opus that defined the open-world genre. It's far from perfect, but it does make a 20 year old game widely playable nowadays.                            
76	                                The compilation isn't the most beautiful or detailed addition to the series, but it plays the smoothest. If you're prepared to overlook, or at least work around, the faults, GTA The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition is well worth considering.                            
70	                                Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - Definitive Edition is kinda rough and kinda janky, but it isn’t quite the disaster that the dogpile claims it is. Sure, the character design looks rough in high resolution and there are a fair number of bugs, but the games largely function as they did three generations back when they released. It ain’t great, but we’ve certainly seen worse.                            
70	                                Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy Definitive Edition isn’t exactly the disaster it’s been made out to be, but it is still a frustrating, underwhelming attempt to modernize three very important games. The quality of life improvements are generally welcome, and in many places, there’s a faithful upgrading of the iconic visual style of the PS2 era titles. Unfortunately, not every change is welcome, and in the case of San Andreas, perhaps a little less of it might have done it a few favours.                            
70	                                We are once again dealing with three great works from the world of video games, it is undeniable. Despite the passing years, the three open-worlds still deliver unforgettable atmospheres and cities teeming with details. The latter precisely are as incredible as they are coherent with these passers-by who go about their business, these multiple secondary axes which add credibility to the whole and especially these new plays of light which sublimate the whole. But it is clear that despite this little more than welcome facelift (which still lacks homogeneity), the experiences show their age. Their gameplay can be dated, especially GTA III which, today, is really difficult to handle. As you can see, this compilation will undoubtedly delight the most curious who want to discover three legends, or even the nostalgic who wish to rediscover the sensations of yesteryear while enjoying a refurbished visual, but will disappoint those looking for more current mechanics.                             
70	                                Grand Theft Auto Trilogy Definitive Edition is a good way to (re)discover three legendary titles of the PS2 era. They're the same and yet very different in terms of visuals. But it's not really 100% good and even on PS5, it struggles to deliver a totally smooth experience. Not to mention that they feel a bit old if you talk about gameplay. Still effective, but be prepared.                             
65	                                A painful missed opportunity. These half-cooked remasters show some qualities but are clearly not enough to celebrate such masterpieces like GTA III, Vice City and San Andreas.                            
65	                                I’m a diehard fan of the GTA series, but I’m of two minds about this up and down port to the Unreal 4 Engine. The initial wow-factor of the visual upgrade is undeniable, but the more you play it, the more cracks appear in that pretty veneer. Some of those are legacy fissures that have not been repaired. Others are eyesore imperfections wrought by a new team of less-than-master craftspeople.                             
65	                                In the end, you’ll hate that you can’t love GTA Trilogy Remastered, at least in its current state, as tons of bugs and performance issues really ruin the fun. That said, if you grew up playing these titles and you can’t wait to get back into the good old days, the game is still playable, although we recommend that you wait for future updates to iron out the issues. As for new generation gamers who are used to modern gameplay and design, there is probably not much to look for here as the core gameplay mechanics of this package are really old.                            
60	                                If you had high expectations for GTA: The Trilogy Definitive Edition, that’s going to be your downfall with these games. The Trilogy is just alright and the upgraded graphics don’t cancel out the missing content and the infuriating bugs. Either play the originals or wait until the remastered games are on sale.                            
60	                                The first polygonal trilogy of GTA is back on the shelves with a definitive edition that struggles to hide the results of a gestation that is perhaps all too fast, a matrix of remasters that would undoubtedly have deserved greater attention in the polishing phase. Although the three titles in the package showcase valuable technical interventions, as well as a good assortment of playful revisions, the result of the modernization process put in place by Grove Street Games stops at sufficiency. This is because the collection shows qualitative fluctuations on almost all fronts, which in some cases significantly affect the enjoyment of the experience. However, the new version of the GTA Trilogy proves to be able to offer fans hours and hours of nostalgic "juggling", as long as they are able to overlook the obvious rough edges in the offer.                             
60	                                If these games shaped or changed you, you might find the notion of their being shaped and changed, in turn, an unwelcome one.                             
60	                                GTA: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition feels far from the ultimate version of these great games right now. Three magnificent open-world adventures have been made available on modern consoles, and they feel much better to play than ever thanks to a set of mechanical tweaks, but the visual overhaul has summoned scores of new problems that make the package difficult to recommend in its current state. Newcomers without nostalgia could still find a lot to love in this collection, but you’d be much better off waiting for patches and updates that will hopefully bring the Trilogy up to scratch so that it can reflect the enduring brilliance of the source material.                            
60	                                These games are all masterpieces and as such deserve a better collection than this. In spite of the flaws it can still be a fun nostalgia trip for old fans or a good way for newer fans to discover the games before Grand Theft Auto V, but between the dated mechanics and inconsistent visual performance, Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy – Definitive Edition is far from perfect.                            
60	                                While not the same level of technical mess as the Switch edition, the PlayStation 5 version still suffers from some hiccups that it really shouldn’t, and the changes to how the characters look won’t be for everyone, but it’s still a good way to play three of the best games ever made.                            
58	                                Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition is definitely ... a disappointment. The technical restyling on the three chapters of the saga was half successful but does not pay the right homage to the original trilogy, while the improvements to the gameplay are not enough to make us forget the many bugs and glitches of this unsuccessful collection.                            
55	                                Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition collects some truly groundbreaking games that still provide their share of nostalgic fun, but little has been done to make them shine here in 2021. Ultimately, a shoddy visual upgrade, choppy performance, and a lack of meaningful updates or extras may leave you questioning why you loved them in the first place. Perhaps this collection can be brought up to snuff with updates from Rockstar (or modders), but for now, its Wanted Level remains low.                            
50	                                Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition is an interesting package; despite doing a number of things fairly well such as gameplay tweaks and refreshed visuals it’s hard not to feel a little let down. When you consider all of the possibilities or additional improvements that could have been made, it just feels like Rockstar could have gone further and created some truly memorable remakes or high-quality remasters. All of the games here do look better and play better than the originals, which technically does make these versions the definitive ones, but it feels like a missed opportunity at the end of the day. A few patches will likely take care of some of the more obvious issues, but at this point it is hard to recommend to anyone other than the GTA faithful.                            
50	                                Three legendary games that are part of the all-time gaming pantheon. Too bad that in their definitive editions they didn't get the respect and care they truly deserved.                            
50	                                Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition lets us re-experience the great stories of three beloved titles. Unfortunately, it fails more than it succeeds.                            
50	                                Here’s the thing, though; despite every issue that the GTA: DE suffers from, I’ve still been having a good time with it. Which is simply a testament to how well-written the Grand Theft Auto series is. The GTA: DE needs a patch. Or, maybe, it needs a boatload of patches. Though, I still find myself enjoying the over-the-top storylines, ridiculous dialogue, and outrageous mission structure. It’s hard to call these definitive, but still easy to call them classics.                            
50	                                All three mainline GTA games from the PS2 era are seminal pieces, and they still hold up to modern scrutiny – the outstanding GTA San Andreas especially. But as remasters these are weak: they chug on modern hardware and are undone by questionable artistic decisions. Rockstar built its reputation on attention to detail, and while all three of these games still come highly recommended, this disappointing compilation will go down as a stain on the label’s record.                            
50	                                The Grand Theft Auto series will always be seen as a cultural milestone in video gaming which led to the open world games that we cherish now, but the years have been a bit harsh on the trilogy and the complete lack of care put into what is essentially an afterthought of a remaster doesn’t help matters much. The few updates made with controls, shooting, and lighting are nice, but not enough to justify the $60 price tag. The games are still worth revisiting, especially if you’ve never played the original releases, but only if you aren’t playing on PC or the Switch as those versions seem to share the bulk of issues the game is currently experiencing. So far PS5 is the way to go for a hassle-free trip into Liberty City, just maybe wait for a price cut first.                            
50	                                There’s no question that the three games in this GTA Trilogy are all-time classics, but they’ve unfortunately been remastered with a ham-hand instead of a Love Fist. New features are slight and only partially implemented, visuals are mixed, performance is inconsistent at best, some content is missing, and bugs and glitches abound. In its existing state, this collection of three classic GTA games is far from being considered definitive; it’s defective, disappointing, and surprisingly disrespectful to both the legacy of the games themselves and their many legions of fans.                            
50	                                Lazy, amateurish, and half-finished are not how you usually expect to describe a Rockstar game, but this easily avoided mess shows three classic games in the least flattering way possible.                            
50	                                Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - Definitive Edition is anything but definitive, with too many issues that simply cannot be overlooked.                            
50	                                Three anthology titles to be played at least once in your life as a gamer, but not necessarily through this GTA Trilogy which is only definitive in name. The new graphic design and the few gameplay modifications sound like cover for the pile of bugs and problems that completely distort the original material. A mirror to the lures sold at an exorbitant price considering its proposal and still unavailable for PC players at the time of closing this review.                            
50	                                Grand Theft Auto 3, Vice City, and San Andreas are some of the PlayStation 2's best games and helped to both pioneer and define the open world genre. Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - Definitive Edition does not provide the best way to experience these titles, nor should this be considered the "definitive" edition of the games included. The Definitive Edition is often prettier and slightly more modern in its controls and presentation, but missing features and poorly optimized content let down what could have been ideal remasters. Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - Definitive Edition feels rushed - and after twenty years, that's disappointing.                            
48	                                GTA: The Trilogy has a total lack of attention to details. At times it seems that Rockstar Games didn't even bother to oversee the work of Grove Street Games. There are some moments and small details that lead one to think that an algorithm was responsible for remastering the graphics and that no human reviewed the final product. GTA deserves more.                            
45	                                Stick to your original copies if you still have them. If you need to see this mess in action for yourself, either wait until developer Grove Street Games heavily patches this collection or wait for a deeply discounted sale.                            
40	                                In simplest terms, Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition is a mess of a release and isn't anything close to the level of quality that we have come to expect from the Rockstar Games name in the past.                             
40	                                These versions of Grand Theft Auto III (2001), Vice City (2002) and San Andreas (2004) are in no way definitive. Seeing them like this is more than a disappointment. It is infuriating.                            
35	                                What should have been a glorious celebration of three leading open world games has turned out to be a major disappointment that is definitely not the 'definitive' way you should experience the games. Don't get me wrong, the games themselves remain great, but the updated (camera) controls and some graphical updates are far from being able to compete with all the missing content and the numerous graphical misses that this collection makes. This makes Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy – The (So Called) Definitive Edition feel like a lazy cash grab that Rockstar Games should be ashamed of.                             
30	                                There is so much wrong with Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition that we doubt that any amount of updates could fix the game in any significant way. As of now, we can only hope that moving forward, Rockstar Games will learn for their mistakes. Or at the very least will find more experienced development partners and invest in quality control. The work done by Grove Street Games is just straight up bad.                            
20	                                GTA: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition is a relic of its time. A relic that was better left unearthed.                            
76	                                GTA Trilogy on Nintendo Switch has problems like the rest of the versions, from an unstable frame rate to a notable popping or blurrier graphics playing on the dock, but they are still three great adventures like a pine tree, with slight improvements, which are highly enjoyable in portable mode.                             
60	                                If you’re coming into Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy expecting each game to look and play like GTA V, prepare for disappointment at a passionless upscaling effort. On the flipside, if you fancy reliving these open world wonders with some of their rougher gameplay edges sanded down, prepare to lose yourself for sixty hours or more.                             
58	                                I’m sure that with plenty of patches, Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition could reach a point where it becomes worth revisiting these games, but at this point in time, that seems a long, long way off.                            
55	                                Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition is a compilation that unfortunately is quite improvable in most aspects and that does not look like a remaster. The feeling that remains is that they have failed to offer these titles with the affection, care and respect they deserved.                            
40	                                Good, fun games are good, fun games, and even with glitches and the numerous issues this trilogy brings, that's what these still are. However, seeing the state of Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition, there just isn't any way to let Rockstar off lightly here. This is one of the most successful video game companies in the world, with goodness knows how much raked in from GTA Online, so there can be no excuses to have loaned out these iconic games to a small team with a poor track record and showing absolutely no respect for its own creations. Fifty pounds is a big ask for such old games that have been what one might say "demastered", and even with numerous future patches, these may never be the upgrades they should have been, but Switch owners new to this trilogy can find plenty of entertainment - and not just because of the glitches. This is still a hard sell, though, with the advice being to hold off for a major sale.                            
40	                                Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition on Switch delivers three of gaming's true greats in a shockingly rough package that manages to suck pretty much all of the fun out of Rockstar's stellar crime epics. This is a poor port, a shoddy, stuttery, low resolution mess full of bugs, glitches, audio problems and more besides. If can grab this one on any other platform, we'd advise you do so or, at the very least, hold off until it's been patched and hopefully improved in the future. As things stand, this is a very, very long way from 'definitive' — this isn't the way we want to remember these games.                            
40	                                Few games have had such a lasting impact on how games were made, or have been quite so successful. People who weren’t into games played those three games. Sadly, if they were to pick them up on Switch now, they'd probably wonder if they were ever good in the first place.                            
30	                                A shocking mishandling of three beloved classics, Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition on Switch is a poorly ported mess of frame rate drops, popping, ugly characters, and bad decisions. Time to dust off the PS2.                             
70	                                We are once again dealing with three great works from the world of video games, it is undeniable. Despite the passing years, the three open-worlds still deliver unforgettable atmospheres and cities teeming with details. The latter precisely are as incredible as they are coherent with these passers-by who go about their business, these multiple secondary axes which add credibility to the whole and especially these new plays of light which sublimate the whole. But it is clear that despite this little more than welcome facelift (which still lacks homogeneity), the experiences show their age. Their gameplay can be dated, especially GTA III which, today, is really difficult to handle. As you can see, this compilation will undoubtedly delight the most curious who want to discover three legends, or even the nostalgic who wish to rediscover the sensations of yesteryear while enjoying a refurbished visual, but will disappoint those looking for more current mechanics.                             
65	                                This comeback of the three GTA classics feels superficial and poorly optimized, although some improvements are clearly visible. It's not the remaster we were hoping for, but these are still immortal classics that can still entertain and sometimes even amaze. And sometimes that's all we need.                            
60	                                GTA: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition brings all the fun of the classic games of the series that has always seen its career rise. However, it shows a hard fall with this remaster due to a lack of work in its execution.                             
60	                                Between the glitches and the questionable artistic choices, GTA Trilogy: The Definitive Edition still reminds us why these games made history and are so fondly remembered. But precisely for that reason, Rockstar Games and Take-Two should  have put more care into this compilation.                            
60	                                A messy remaster of three genre-defining open worlds, Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition fails in giving GTA III, Vice City, and San Andreas the treatment they deserve, but beneath the slightly shabby veneer, those same great games remain.                            
60	                                The inherent strengths of GTA 3, Vice City, and San Andreas allow GTA: The Trilogy to be an enjoyable experience on a very fundamental level, but as a remaster – especially as a remaster of three of the greatest games ever made – it falls short of expectations. These games deserve much better, and it’s disappointing that Rockstar doesn’t understand that.                            
58	                                Quotation forthcoming.                            
45	                                It’s not that I’m mad, I am just disappointed. These three PS2 games remain iconic, and I have enjoyed returning to Liberty City, Vice City and San Andreas, but as a remaster, Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition is lacking the care and respect such highly regarded games deserve. It doesn’t have the quality we have come to expect from remasters recently. Yet, such is their quality, the underlying games, which deserved better, still hold up as a product of their time. They are worth returning to if the PS2 GTA Trilogy holds a special place in your heart, so long as you can temper expectations and accept the good, the bad and the downright ugly from a ‘that’ll do’ remaster. If not, you’re better off persevering them with those rose-tinted memories.                            
40	                                While the core gameplay of GTA Trilogy is truly incredible, the overall package feels rushed and haphazard. Those desperate for old school GTA on modern consoles should check the collection out, especifically if the promised Grand Theft Auto Trilogy fixes come through, but everyone else can safely skip it.                            
40	                                For two decades, the three GTA games from the PlayStation 2 era symbolized the rise of the open world genre. Their groundbreaking freedom and timeless music gave us memories for life. Now these historic games instantly symbolize what a remaster should absolutely not do.
